// The gallery's catalog, and the arrangement built from it.
//
// The gallery is a sample app, so nothing here tests the library. What it tests
// is the LIST: every sample reachable by an id of its own, every group complete,
// and a menu row for each. That list is the thing this app will rot through - a
// sample renamed and not renamed everywhere, a group left empty, a card pointing
// at nothing - and none of it is visible until the app is running and someone
// taps the wrong row.
//
// Building the tree is the whole test harness: `GalleryScene().windows.main.node` produces
// the Node tree the host would be sent, with no renderer, no host and no device
// involved. And WHERE THE GALLERY IS is state on this side - so a move is
// tested by firing the handler a user would touch and reading the boxes it
// wrote, with no acts, no host and nothing to await.
