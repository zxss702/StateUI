// Colouring a listing, in the language it is written in.
//
// A Text has one text colour, so text in six colours is six spans - which is
// what `Text.spans` is for. This file turns a snippet into those runs.
//
// ASCII only, on purpose. Deciding what is a letter with `Character.isLetter`
// would work, but the whole question of which Unicode tables that reaches is one
// this repository would rather not open - the README's rule against ICU-backed
// APIs, and the per-platform measurements behind it, say why. Every
// keyword and every type name in a listing is ASCII, and anything else
// falls through as plain text, which is the right answer for it anyway.
