/// The gallery's one navigational shape - a row on a group's page.
///
/// The WHOLE card answers a tap: a view with `.onTapGesture` on it, not a button
/// with something around it. The chevron is a chevron - it says where the row goes and nothing more.
/// And because a tapped ZStack shows nothing where a Button would, the card
/// says the press back itself: a quick dip in scale before the action runs.
///
/// A FILL and a hairline, which is what makes it read as raised on the tinted
/// page behind it - see `Palette.surface`. Both come from the "Card" style,
/// so nothing here says what a card looks like.
///
/// It is shaped the way every control in the library is, and that shape is the
/// rule for a composed view of your own: WHAT IT IS goes in the initializer -
/// with no default, so leaving it out is not a thing that can happen - and
/// everything a caller may leave out is a MODIFIER returning `Self`, one copy
/// and one assignment, as this card's `picture` modifier is written.
///
/// Its own modifiers are written FIRST, before the ones every view has:
/// `.margin` and friends give back a `ModifiedContent`, which is a view and no
/// longer a `Card`.
