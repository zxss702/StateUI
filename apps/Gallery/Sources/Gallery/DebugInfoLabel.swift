/// The build reading for the closure this call sits in, drawn in its top right
/// corner.
///
/// A CALL AND NOT A VIEW, which is the whole of why it works. `debugInfo()`
/// answers about the description that is RUNNING when it is called, so a
/// reading taken inside a container's braces counts THAT container - the very
/// closure a state read there rebuilds. A view of its own would push a
/// description of its own in front and answer about itself: `1 build, with its
/// parent`, for ever, whatever the sample is doing.
///
/// So it is written exactly where the question is, and the sample's `code`
/// shows it in the same place:
///
///     VStack {
///         DebugInfoLabel()                    // the outer closure: reads nothing
///
///         VStack {
///             DebugInfoLabel()                // this one: built whenever `volume` moves
///             Text("Volume \(volume)")
///         }
///     }
///
/// - Returns: the count and the reason - `41 builds, for volume` - as a label
///   the caller may go on modifying, which is what a grid cell needs.
