/// properties: WHERE IT IS (`Navigation` - the section, what is pushed and
/// presented, whether the menu is open), WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE (`SessionStyle` -
/// the font and the accent its Fonts and Colours windows choose), what its
/// window's chrome says (`TitleBarState`) and what its window has said about
/// its life (`WindowLog`) - and the catalog of samples it shows. `nav` and
/// `style` are offered to every window of the gallery, which is how its windows
/// share one context: nothing is passed between the Colours window and the
/// bars it paints. The rest is handed to the main window, which reads it.
///

/// the catalog this gallery keeps carries the samples, that state survives for
/// as long as the gallery does, pushes and pops included. A second gallery
