// Where a gallery is, and every move it can make.
//
// This file is the gallery's whole navigation model, and there is nothing in the
// library like it - deliberately. A `NavigationStack` takes an ARRAY the author
// holds; a `NavigationSplitView` takes a `Bool`; a `TabView` takes a value of the
// author's own type. What is in those, what the moves are called and what a move
// means are this application's business, so they are written here.
//
// Which is the answer to "where is the router?": an application that wants one
// writes it, in about forty lines, with its own names. The library ships
// containers and bindings and no router at all - a second one under a library
// name would be the second way to do something, which this library refuses.
