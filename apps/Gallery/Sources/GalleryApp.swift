// The gallery's user interface, written in Swift.
//
// Everything in this directory is compiled into a SEPARATE Swift module from the
// SwiftOmniUI library - named after the project, so here it is
// "GalleryUI". The dependency runs one way: this module imports
// SwiftOmniUI, never the reverse. That is what allows the library to be published
// on its own, and what lets a second app exist alongside this one without either
// knowing about the other.
//
// HOW THIS IS LAID OUT:
//
//     GalleryApp.swift   the application - its scene, what it writes into its
//                        session, and the one function this module exports
//     Gallery/           the gallery itself: one gallery as a scene
//                        (GalleryScene.swift), its window and the arrangement in
//                        it (MainWindow.swift), where it is (Navigation.swift),
//                        what a sample is, the catalog of them, and the pages
//                        that show them
//     Styles/            what the app looks like: its palette and its styles
//     Samples/           one file per sample, in the group it belongs to
//
// ADDING A SAMPLE: write it under Samples/<Group>/ and name it in
// Gallery/Catalog.swift. Nothing else changes - the menu, the home page and the
// route that opens it are all built from that list.
//
// Nothing lists these files: the build discovers them by globbing this
// directory, subdirectories and all.
