// hosts that can realize it: an `MTKView` drawing with Metal on AppKit and UIKit, a
// `GtkGLArea` drawing with OpenGL 3.3 on GTK, a `SwapChainPanel` drawing with
// Direct3D 11.1 on WinUI, a `TextureView` drawn into with OpenGL ES 3.0 on
// Android.

// `View`, shared, with each host saying what it IS on screen. This one is
// declared under a condition, because the view behind it draws on the GPU in
// the platform's own way. `GalleryElements` lists it under the same
// condition, so no other host is held to a promise it cannot keep.
//
// PUBLIC, because a host in the same process registers BY TYPE and lives in a
// module of its own - see GalleryContract.swift.
