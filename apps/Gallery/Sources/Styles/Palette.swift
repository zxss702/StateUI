// The few colours the gallery says for itself.
//
// A colour written as a pair - `Color(light:dark:)` - follows the color scheme: the
// half the system is asking for is picked as the view wearing it is built, and
// a change of color scheme builds exactly the views wearing one again. So nothing here
// has to know which color scheme is on, and neither does anything using it - which is
// why every name below is one name rather than two.
//
// These are for what a colour is FOR. What it IS is in AppColors beside this,
// and almost everything reaches it through here; the colours that must not
// follow the color scheme, and a sample showing a colour of its own, read it directly.
