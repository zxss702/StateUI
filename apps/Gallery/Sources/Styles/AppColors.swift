// The gallery's raw colours: the StateUI ramp - Swift's orange against a deep
// violet, so the gallery looks like this library rather than like a template.
//
// Two decisions carry the whole look, and neither is decoration:
//
//   - THE NEUTRALS ARE TINTED VIOLET, not grey. A #808080 is what an interface
//     has when nobody chose; a neutral carrying a trace of the brand hue reads
//     as one designed thing. It is a few points of blue in every step of the
//     ramp, and it is the difference between the two.
//   - THE ACCENT IS SWIFT'S ORANGE, against a violet ground. Near-complementary,
//     so anything accented separates from what is around it without being made
//     bigger or bolder.
//
// The interactive orange is DEEPER than Swift's own in the light color scheme and
// LIGHTER in the dark: white on #F05138 is 3.5:1, which fails WCAG AA for text,
// while #CE3F1C is 4.8:1. The brand orange stays exactly Swift's wherever
// nothing has to be read on top of it.
//
// What the gallery draws with is next door in Palette.swift - these are the raw
// values, named for what they ARE, and almost everything reaches them through
// that file; the colours that must not follow the color scheme, and a sample showing a
// colour of its own, read them directly.
