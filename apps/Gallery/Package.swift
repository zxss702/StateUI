import PackageDescription

// The application's own Swift module.
//
// Beside Sources/, so SwiftPM keeps .build/ and Package.resolved out of the
// source tree while the application code remains grouped below Sources/.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
// SourceKit - the language server behind Swift support in VS Code and Xcode -
// only understands code that belongs to a SwiftPM package. Without a manifest it
// reports "No such module 'StateUI'" and offers no completion, even though the
// build itself works fine, because the build scripts pass -I explicitly.
//
// GalleryUI is the platform-neutral application module. Executable host targets
// import it and select a native renderer without changing the application's UI.

// WHETHER THIS BUILD HAS AN APPKIT HEAD.
//
// Platforms/AppKit is one host's half and nothing else has any business
// compiling it: it imports StateUIAppKit, and it is written against elements
// the application declares for that host alone. So the target, the product it
// makes and the dependency it needs are declared only when an AppKit build
// asks for them - .scripts/AppKit/build-gallery-appkit.sh sets this - and
// `swift test` neither resolves that package nor compiles a line of that
// folder. Which is what putting a host's half in a folder of its own was for.
//
// AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE, because a manifest cannot read a compilation
// condition: a flag given to a build reaches its targets and never the
// manifest that describes them.
//
// .vscode/settings.json sets it as well, so an editor resolves the folder and
// - through the definition below - completes the code inside `#if APPKIT`.
let hasAppKitHead = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["STATEUI_APPKIT"] == "1"

// And the same for Platforms/Android, the Android Views head:
// .scripts/Android/build-swift.sh sets STATEUI_ANDROID.
let hasAndroidHead = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["STATEUI_ANDROID"] == "1"

// And for Platforms/WinUI, the WinUI 3 head: .scripts/WinUI/run-app.ps1 sets
// STATEUI_WINUI.
let hasWinUIHead = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["STATEUI_WINUI"] == "1"

// And for Platforms/GTK, the GTK 4 head: .scripts/GTK/run-app.sh sets
// STATEUI_GTK.
let hasGTKHead = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["STATEUI_GTK"] == "1"

// And for Platforms/UIKit, the UIKit head on iOS and iPadOS:
// .scripts/UIKit/build-app.sh sets STATEUI_UIKIT.
let hasUIKitHead = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["STATEUI_UIKIT"] == "1"

// What every module of the application is compiled with. In an AppKit build
// that includes APPKIT, the condition Swift written for that host alone stands
// under - defined HERE rather than by a compiler flag, so the one variable
// says both things, and an editor that sets it compiles and completes the code
// inside `#if APPKIT` like any other.
