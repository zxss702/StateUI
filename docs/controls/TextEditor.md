# TextEditor

A text field of several lines.

Layer: `native`. Every base host presents it with its native toolkit.

Inherits: [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md) · [VisualElement](tiers/VisualElement.md) · [View](tiers/View.md) · [InputView](tiers/InputView.md) · [TextElement](tiers/TextElement.md) · [TextStyleElement](tiers/TextStyleElement.md) · [FontElement](tiers/FontElement.md) · [TextAlignmentElement](tiers/TextAlignmentElement.md)

| Mark | Meaning |
| :---: | --- |
| ✅ | Proven by every test of it that ran on that host. |
| ☑️ | Proven, the host recording what is missing. |
| – | Never on that host's family, which meets the contract there. |
| ❌ | A test of it failed. |
| ◐ | Some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read. |
| 🔌 | Proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's. |
| · | The driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs. |
| ⏸ | Its test waits on a member the host does not realize. |
| ⌛ | Said at another revision of its family than it stands at. |
| empty | Not realized, or no run - the note says which. |

See [the dictionary](README.md) for how a mark is given.

What anything carrying values in the tree has - a control, a `Style`, a text run: the name automation finds it by.

## From [VisualElement](tiers/VisualElement.md)

What every drawn element has: its size and its bounds, how it is shown and turned, whether it answers input and holds the keyboard focus, the visual states it enters, and what a screen reader says about it.
