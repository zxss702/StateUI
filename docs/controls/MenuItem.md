# MenuItem

One entry in a menu.

Layer: `structure`. It carries structure or protocol data rather than configuring a visual platform object.

| Mark | Meaning |
| :---: | --- |
| ✅ | Proven by every test of it that ran on that host. |
| ☑️ | Proven, the host recording what is missing. |
| – | Never on that host's family, which meets the contract there. |
| ❌ | A test of it failed. |
| ◐ | Some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read. |
| 🔌 | Proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's. |
| · | The driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs. |
| ⏸ | Its test waits on a member the host does not realize. |
| ⌛ | Said at another revision of its family than it stands at. |
| empty | Not realized, or no run - the note says which. |

See [the dictionary](README.md) for how a mark is given.

## MenuItem's own members

MenuItem declares no members of its own.

## From [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md)

What anything carrying values in the tree has - a control, a `Style`, a text run: the name automation finds it by.

| `accessibilityIdentifier` | property | `String` | native | ☑️ | ✅ | – | ✅ |  |  | Only an entry of a context menu carries it; an entry the page puts in the menu bar does not.; Android Views: An Android menu entry holds no identifier: automation finds it by its title.; GTK 4: not realized |

## From [MenuItemElement](tiers/MenuItemElement.md)

What every item a user chooses from has - a menu's entry, a toolbar's item: a caption, a picture, and something to run.
