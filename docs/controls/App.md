<!-- Rendered by ControlDictionaryTests from the contracts and the verdicts each host's runs of its tests wrote under exports/marks: STATEUI_UPDATE_DOCS=1 swift test --filter ControlDictionaryTests writes it again. -->

# App

The application at the root of a StateUI tree, and what its host does for it with no control behind it: questions for the user, the clock and the time zone, the screen reader, what is kept.

Layer: `structure`. It carries structure or protocol data rather than configuring a visual platform object.

Inherits nothing: every member below is its own.

| Mark | Meaning |
| :---: | --- |
| ✅ | Proven by every test of it that ran on that host. |
| ☑️ | Proven, the host recording what is missing. |
| – | Never on that host's family, which meets the contract there. |
| ❌ | A test of it failed. |
| ◐ | Some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read. |
| 🔌 | Proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's. |
| · | The driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs. |
| ⏸ | Its test waits on a member the host does not realize. |
| ⌛ | Said at another revision of its family than it stands at. |
| empty | Not realized, or no run - the note says which. |

See [the dictionary](README.md) for how a mark is given.
