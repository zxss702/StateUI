# Page

What a container shows as a screen: a window's page, a stack's root and destinations, a tab, either half of a split view, a sheet.

Layer: `adaptive`. Every base host presents it by its platform's conventions, keeping StateUI's state contract.

Inherits: [PageElement](tiers/PageElement.md)

| Mark | Meaning |
| :---: | --- |
| ✅ | Proven by every test of it that ran on that host. |
| ☑️ | Proven, the host recording what is missing. |
| – | Never on that host's family, which meets the contract there. |
| ❌ | A test of it failed. |
| ◐ | Some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read. |
| 🔌 | Proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's. |
| · | The driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs. |
| ⏸ | Its test waits on a member the host does not realize. |
| ⌛ | Said at another revision of its family than it stands at. |
| empty | Not realized, or no run - the note says which. |

See [the dictionary](README.md) for how a mark is given.

What a page shows about itself where another container presents it as an item - a title and a picture.
