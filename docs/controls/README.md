# Control dictionary

Every element StateUI declares - each control, and each part an application, its windows and its pages are made of - member by member, with what each target host's tests proved of it.

A page is its element's contract rendered: the members it declares itself, then one section per tier it wears, each linking that tier's page. Every member shows its kind - a property, an event or an act - its value, the layer that realizes it, and a mark for each platform, because a host realizes the same inherited member differently on different elements: a background is a layer colour on a label and a drawn fill on an outlined layout.

<!-- legend:begin -->
| Mark | Meaning |
| :---: | --- |
| ✅ | Proven by every test of it that ran on that host. |
| ☑️ | Proven, the host recording what is missing. |
| – | Never on that host's family, which meets the contract there. |
| ❌ | A test of it failed. |
| ◐ | Some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read. |
| 🔌 | Proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's. |
| · | The driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs. |
| ⏸ | Its test waits on a member the host does not realize. |
| ⌛ | Said at another revision of its family than it stands at. |
| empty | Not realized, or no run - the note says which. |
<!-- legend:end -->

A host's column is its tests' verdicts: each host's suite runs the conformance families - one for each contract, a case for every cell of every page - and writes what each said under `exports/marks/<host>/`, one line a member of an element, read here. A host's register - its records, what its runtime registers, what it never has - decides whether a case runs and what its verdict says, and nothing it declares marks a cell by itself. A tier's member is marked on every element wearing the tier, each by its own case. A row has one Notes cell for every host: AppKit's note as written, then each other host's as `Android Views: …`, joined by `; `. Nothing on a page is written by hand: `ControlDictionaryTests` fails when a page or a table below differs from the contracts and the verdicts, or when a verdict names what no contract declares, and `STATEUI_UPDATE_DOCS=1 swift test --filter ControlDictionaryTests` writes them again.

The scene, the window and the page an application is made of, the arrangements a page can be, the entries of its toolbar and menus, and the slots and parts the others hold.

## Tiers

Members many elements share, declared once.

<!-- tiers:begin -->
- [PropertyContainer](tiers/PropertyContainer.md) - What anything carrying values in the tree has - a control, a `Style`, a text run: the name automation finds it by.
- [VisualElement](tiers/VisualElement.md) - What every drawn element has: its size and its bounds, how it is shown and turned, whether it answers input and holds the keyboard focus, the visual states it enters, and what a screen reader says about it.
- [View](tiers/View.md) - What every view a layout positions has: where it sits in its layout, the space kept around it, and the gestures, drags and frame reports it answers.
- [Layout](tiers/Layout.md) - What every layout has: the screen's unsafe strips it keeps clear of, and whether its children are clipped or let input through.
- [StackBase](tiers/StackBase.md) - What both stacks have: the space between their children.
- [InputView](tiers/InputView.md) - What every field a user types into has: the text's limits and caret, the keyboard it asks for, and the placeholder shown while it is empty.
- [Shape](tiers/Shape.md) - What every drawn shape has: what fills it, the line around it, how it fits its room, and a transform of its own drawing.
- [TextElement](tiers/TextElement.md) - What every element showing words has: the words, and the case they are drawn in.
- [TextStyleElement](tiers/TextStyleElement.md) - How text looks wherever it is drawn: its colour and the space between its letters.
- [FontElement](tiers/FontElement.md) - The font text is drawn in: its family, its size, its weight and slant, and whether it follows the user's text-size setting.
- [TextAlignmentElement](tiers/TextAlignmentElement.md) - Where text sits inside the space its own element was given.
- [LineHeightElement](tiers/LineHeightElement.md) - How far apart the lines of text are.
- [DecorableTextElement](tiers/DecorableTextElement.md) - The lines drawn through or under text.
- [PaddingElement](tiers/PaddingElement.md) - The space kept inside an element, around what it holds.
- [BorderElement](tiers/BorderElement.md) - What an element draws of its own box: the shape its background, its outline and its cut follow, and the outline.
- [ImageElement](tiers/ImageElement.md) - How a picture fills the room it was given.
- [TintElement](tiers/TintElement.md) - A control's one accent colour.
- [BarElement](tiers/BarElement.md) - The bar a page arrangement draws: its colour.
- [MenuItemElement](tiers/MenuItemElement.md) - What every item a user chooses from has - a menu's entry, a toolbar's item: a caption, a picture, and something to run.
- [PageElement](tiers/PageElement.md) - What a page shows about itself where another container presents it as an item - a title and a picture.
- [ControlSizeElement](tiers/ControlSizeElement.md) - How big a control draws - a button, a progress bar, a spinner.
- [ScrollContentElement](tiers/ScrollContentElement.md) - What shows behind a scrollable view's content - a list's or an editor's own canvas, where the platform draws one.
<!-- tiers:end -->

## Layers

Which layer realizes an element or a member - the word each page and each row uses.

<!-- layers:begin -->
- `native` - Every base host presents it with its native toolkit.
- `adaptive` - Every base host presents it by its platform's conventions, keeping StateUI's state contract.
- `stateUI` - StateUI composes it from smaller primitives before a host receives the tree.
- `structure` - It carries structure or protocol data rather than configuring a visual platform object.
- `provider` - An optional provider supplies it: a package, or the application that registers it with its hosts.
<!-- layers:end -->
