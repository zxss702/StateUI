# PageElement

What a page shows about itself where another container presents it as an item - a title and a picture. A page and an arrangement say them under the same keys, so both wear this tier, and it wears nothing: a page carries its title and its icon, and no other value an element carries.

Worn by: [NavigationSplitView](../NavigationSplitView.md) · [NavigationStack](../NavigationStack.md) · [Page](../Page.md) · [TabView](../TabView.md)

Declared in `lib/StateUI/Sources/Contracts/Mixins/PageElementContract.swift`.

How each of them realizes these members is on its own page.
