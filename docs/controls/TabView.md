# TabView

A page showing several pages, one at a time, with a bar to choose between them.

Layer: `adaptive`. Every base host presents it by its platform's conventions, keeping StateUI's state contract.

| Mark | Meaning |
| :---: | --- |
| ✅ | Proven by every test of it that ran on that host. |
| ☑️ | Proven, the host recording what is missing. |
| – | Never on that host's family, which meets the contract there. |
| ❌ | A test of it failed. |
| ◐ | Some of its tests proved it, another could not run or read. |
| 🔌 | Proven only through the host's own entry or record, not the toolkit's. |
| · | The driver cannot yet do or read what its test needs. |
| ⏸ | Its test waits on a member the host does not realize. |
| ⌛ | Said at another revision of its family than it stands at. |
| empty | Not realized, or no run - the note says which. |

See [the dictionary](README.md) for how a mark is given.

| Host | Created | Members (10) | Realization | Notes |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| AppKit | ✅ | 2 ✅ | `NSTabView`: tabless under a full-width select-one `NSSegmentedControl` beneath the toolbar - the split view detail's `NSSplitViewItemAccessoryViewController` on macOS 26 and later, else the title bar's bottom accessory - with top tabs where no window serves it |  |
| UIKit | ✅ | 6 ✅ | `UITabBarController` |  |
| Android Views | ✅ | 1 ✅ | custom `LinearLayout` tab row |  |
| WinUI 3 | ✅ | 4 ✅ | `NavigationView` with a top pane |  |
| GTK 4 | ✅ |  | `GtkStack` + `GtkStackSwitcher`; libadwaita `AdwViewStack` |  |
| Web |  |  | ARIA `tablist` | no host yet |
