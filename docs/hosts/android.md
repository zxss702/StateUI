# Android Views host

The Android Views host renders a SwiftOmniUI application with Android views. It is
Swift, in the application's own process, beside the application module and the
library: it applies the typed sparse patches of the
[host contract](../internals/host-contract.md) directly and calls the views through JNI.

It presents SwiftOmniUI's controls, arrangements and pages over the runtime every
host shares - the [platform contract](../platform-contract.md#control-creation) says
which, member by member - and shows any other control's name in red where the control
belongs, so a gap is visible rather than silent.

```

## Requirements

The host builds on macOS, for Android 9 (API 28) or newer:

- Swift 6.4 from swift.org, `swift-6.4.0-RELEASE`, and the Swift SDK for
  Android of the same release, installed with `swift sdk install`. Xcode's own
  Swift 6.4 is a different build and cannot read the SDK's modules;
  `build-swift.sh` finds the matching toolchain by itself;
- the Android NDK r30 or newer: the one `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT` or
  `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` names, else the
  one the Swift SDK's setup linked into its bundle, else the Android SDK's
  newest;
- the Android SDK with platform 36 and its build tools, and JDK 21 for
  Gradle. The scripts fetch Gradle itself the first time.

## The head

An application's Android head is a library Android loads. Its `JNI_OnLoad`
names the application and hands the virtual machine to the host:

```swift quote
import NotesUI
import SwiftOmniUIAndroid

@_cdecl("JNI_OnLoad")
public func JNI_OnLoad(_ machine: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, _ reserved: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Int32 {
    swiftomniui_app_register()
    return SwiftOmniUIAndroid.load(machine)
}
```

The head's `AndroidManifest.xml` declares the host's activity,
`swiftomniui.android.SwiftOmniUIActivity`, with the library to load as its
`swiftomniui.library`. The activity loads it and starts the host; an application
needs no Java of its own. Its `build.gradle.kts` depends on AndroidX's
`recyclerview`, the collection an List stands on. One that extends the host with views of its own
keeps their Java beside the head, in `Java/`, and may extend the activity,
declaring its own class in the manifest instead.

`SWIFTOMNIUI_HOST=android` is what makes a build an Android Views one: the
application's manifest reads it, declares the `Platforms/Android/Swift` target,
the library it makes and the `SwiftOmniUIAndroid` dependency, and defines the
`ANDROID` compilation condition for every module of the application. Swift
written for this host alone stands under `#if ANDROID`. `build-swift.sh` sets
nothing else: the library itself is built as every host builds it.

A new application made in `apps/` - **SwiftOmniUI: New App in apps/**, or
`.scripts/new-app.sh` - has an Android head, as HelloWorld does, and runs and
is debugged as soon as it is made.

## Controls, acts, and events registered in Swift

An application extends the host from its Android head. Registrations run in
`JNI_OnLoad`, on the UI thread - the main actor's - before
`SwiftOmniUIAndroid.load`. Registering a contract or an act again replaces the
earlier registration. Every registration is written against the
application's own contracts, so they are `public`: the host lives in a module
of its own and must see them. The Gallery's Android halves are in
`apps/Gallery/Platforms/Android/`: Swift in `Swift/Host/`, Java in `Java/`.

### A control

A control of the application's own is an object holding the Android view it
shows, an `AndroidControl`. The view is a class of the application's own
Java, made from Swift through `Java` - the host's JNI, the same calls it
makes itself - with the activity, `SwiftOmniUIAndroid.context`, and held as a
`JavaObject`. `SwiftOmniUIControls.add` says which contract it realizes:

```swift quote
public static func add<Realized: ElementContract, Made: AndroidControl>(
    _ contract: Realized.Type,
    create: @escaping (AndroidReports<Realized>) -> Made,
    members: (AndroidRegistration<Realized, Made>) -> Void = { _ in })
```

- **`create`** makes the control once per element, and wires what it reports:
  `reports.raise(Contract.member, values)` for an event of the element's own,
  and `reports.report(property, value, as: event)` for a value the USER
  changed.
- **`members`** registers what the control takes: `property(_:_:)` hands a
  value over as the type its contract declares, `nil` where it is no longer
  described, and `raises(_:)` records an event the control raises.

```swift quote
SwiftOmniUIControls.add(TrafficLightContract.self, create: { reports -> TrafficLightView in
    let light = TrafficLightView()
    light.onLampTapped = { index in reports.raise(TrafficLightContract.lampTapped, index) }
    return light
}) { light in
    light.property(TrafficLightContract.signal) { control, signal in
        control.signal = signal ?? .stop
    }
    light.raises(TrafficLightContract.lampTapped)
}
```

The host places, sizes and shows the view as it does its own - margins,
alignment, opacity, gestures, frame reports - measuring it by the view's own
`onMeasure`. A registered control is a leaf. The view tells its Swift half
what the user did through a native method of the application's own, found by
its JNI name (`@_cdecl("Java_..._lampTapped")`), handed the number the
control made it with. A control that draws with the GPU is a view like any
other: the Gallery's `Cube3D` is a `TextureView` whose surface Swift draws
into with OpenGL ES 3.0 over EGL, following the display's frames only while
it spins and stands in a window - the same declaration Metal draws on AppKit.

### An act

`SwiftOmniUIActs.add` registers a function the application calls by its act, and
`SwiftOmniUIActs.add(_:on:_:)` one aimed at the application's own element, handed
that element's control:

```swift quote
SwiftOmniUIActs.add(GalleryContract.setClipboard) { text in
    Java.frame {
        Java.callStatic(device, copy, .object(SwiftOmniUIAndroid.context), .object(Java.string(text)))
    }
}

SwiftOmniUIActs.add(RatingBarContract.flash, on: RatingBarView.self) { bar in
    bar.flash()
}
```

A performer runs on the UI thread, and may await, the call answered once it
returns. Its arguments and answer are the act's own types; a call carrying
anything else fails with the reason. A thrown error fails the act, and so does
an aim at nothing; an act nobody registered is refused by name.

### An event without a control

`SwiftOmniUIEvents.raise` pushes an event of the application's that belongs to no
element, from any thread; `SwiftOmniUIEvents.raises` declares it before the host
starts, so a handler listening for one no source raises is told so. Its
source is often Android's own - the Gallery's activity registers a receiver
for the battery while it lives:

```swift quote
SwiftOmniUIEvents.raises(GalleryContract.batteryChanged)
SwiftOmniUIEvents.raise(GalleryContract.batteryChanged, level, charging)
```

## Running

```bash
.scripts/Android/devices.sh list
.scripts/Android/run-app.sh apps/HelloWorld debug emulator-5554
.scripts/Android/run-app.sh apps/Gallery debug emulator-5554
```

`run-app.sh` builds the application's Swift for the device's ABI alone, then
the APK, installs it, starts it and follows its log. Everything a build writes
stays in the application's `.build/android/`. The APK carries the libraries
the head needs and nothing else - the Swift runtime's own among them -
stripped, with the unstripped copies kept in `.build/android/symbols/` for
`ndk-stack` and a debugger. Android draws no SVG, so the application's
`Resources/Images` are drawn for it as the APK is built: an SVG three times
over, as a PNG, which `Image("mark.png")` finds as it finds the SVG on every
other host. An application's `print` reaches logcat under the
tag `SwiftOmniUI`, and so does what `SWIFTOMNIUI_TALLY=1` and `SWIFTOMNIUI_INSPECT=1`
write: `run-app.sh` hands every `SWIFTOMNIUI_` variable of the shell that runs it
to the application's environment. A head's manifest asks for
`ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`, which the host needs to report the network to the
application's views.

In VS Code, choose **Android** as the host and a device, and press **F5**.

## Debugging

**SwiftOmniUI: Debug** builds, installs and starts the application as `run-app.sh`
does, and then attaches `lldb-dap` to it: a breakpoint in the application, in
SwiftOmniUI or in the host stops it, with its source, its stack and its variables.
It is the application running that is attached to, so what runs before - the
first render - runs without the debugger. Only a debug build can be debugged.

`run-app.sh --debugger` readies it: the NDK's `lldb-server` runs as the
application, in its own sandbox, and `.build/android/debugger.json` says where
it listens and which process to attach to. From a terminal, with the toolchain's
`lldb`:

```bash
.scripts/Android/run-app.sh apps/Gallery debug emulator-5554 --no-logcat --debugger
cat apps/Gallery/.build/android/debugger.json
lldb -o "settings set plugin.jit-loader.gdb.enable off" \
     -o "platform select remote-android" \
     -o "platform connect unix-abstract-connect://emulator-5554/com.swiftomniui.gallery/swiftomniui-debugger.sock" \
     -o "settings append target.exec-search-paths $PWD/apps/Gallery/.build/android/symbols/arm64-v8a" \
     -o "process attach --pid <process from debugger.json>" \
     -o "process handle SIGSEGV SIGBUS --pass true --stop false --notify false"
```

The libraries are read from the build, which kept them unstripped; they must
be the ones installed, so the application is always run through the script
before it is attached to. Android's runtime raises SIGSEGV and SIGBUS on purpose,
and the debugger passes them to it rather than stopping. Nor does the debugger
follow the code the runtime's JIT compiles: the runtime announces each method
it compiles, and a debugger that reads each announcement stops the whole
application every time - over USB, opening a page took seconds. End a session by
detaching - stopping the debugger itself leaves its breakpoints in the
application, which the next of them then ends.

## Testing

A view exists only in an application's process, so the host's suite is a
library a test APK loads, run on the device's UI thread by its
instrumentation:

```bash
.scripts/Android/test-android.sh emulator-5554
```

The suite is XCTest. With no discovery on Android, each test case lists its
tests in `allTests` and the runner lists the cases; `test-android.sh` refuses
to run while a test or a case is listed nowhere.

The test APK can be built on one machine and run on another:
`test-android.sh --build x86_64` builds it for that ABI with no device and
prints where it is, and `SWIFTOMNIUI_TEST_APK=<apk> test-android.sh` installs
that APK instead of building one. CI builds on macOS, where the build draws
the pictures, and runs the suite on a Linux emulator.
