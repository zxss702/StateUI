# UIKit host

The UIKit host renders a SwiftOmniUI application with UIKit controls on iOS and
iPadOS. It is Swift, in the application's own process, beside the application
module and the library: it applies the typed sparse patches of the
[host contract](../internals/host-contract.md) directly, over the runtime every host
shares.

It presents SwiftOmniUI's controls, arrangements and pages - the
[platform contract](../platform-contract.md#control-creation) says which, member by
member - and shows any other control's name in red where the control belongs,
so a gap is visible rather than silent.

```

## Requirements

The host builds on macOS with Xcode, for iOS and iPadOS 26 or newer, and runs
on a simulator or on an iPhone or iPad paired with the Mac. `build-app.sh`
builds with Xcode's Swift against the simulator's SDK, for
`arm64-apple-ios26.0-simulator`, or against the device's, for
`arm64-apple-ios26.0`. A device runs with Developer Mode on, and its build is
signed with a development profile of this Mac's that provisions it - one
Xcode makes for a team once the device is added - and a certificate of the
keychain's that the profile names: the script picks them as Xcode does, an
exact application identifier before a wildcard.

## The head

An application's UIKit head is `Platforms/UIKit/main.swift`. It registers the
application, says what this host answers for it, then starts the host, which
never returns:

```swift quote
import NotesUI
import SwiftOmniUIUIKit

swiftomniui_app_register()

// The controls this host realizes, the acts it performs, and the pushes it
// reports. Each lives in Host/ beside this file.
NotesControls.register()
NotesActs.register()
NotesEventSources.start()

SwiftOmniUIUIKit.run()
```

The bundle `build-app.sh` makes carries the application's `Resources/Images`
in `Images/`, every SVG drawn three times over as PNGs, which
`Image("mark.png")` finds as it finds the SVG on every other host, and the
SwiftOmniUI libraries in `Frameworks/`. Its icon is drawn from
`Resources/AppIcon`: `appicon_bkg.svg` over the whole of a 1024-pixel square
and `appicon_mark.svg` in its middle, opaque, which iOS rounds itself. Its
`Info.plist` says the application supports many scenes.

`SWIFTOMNIUI_UIKIT=1` is what makes a build a UIKit one: the application's
manifest reads it, declares the `Platforms/UIKit` target and its
`SwiftOmniUIUIKit` dependency, and defines the `UIKIT` compilation condition for
every module of the application. Swift written for this host alone stands
under `#if UIKIT`.

A new application made in `apps/` - **SwiftOmniUI: New App in apps/**, or
`.scripts/new-app.sh` - has a UIKit head, as HelloWorld does.

## Scenes and windows

Each SwiftOmniUI window stands in a window scene of its own. On an iPad the
application opens as many scenes as its windows ask for, and the user moves
between them and closes them as between any application's windows: a window
hears it is activated, put in the background and closed by the user as its
scene is. A window the application closes leaves the one the user was in
before in front of them. On an iPhone one scene stands, and a second window
has none to stand in.

A window's pages are UIKit's own controllers - a navigation controller for a
`NavigationStack`, a tab bar controller for a `TabView`, a split view
controller for a `NavigationSplitView` - and its sheets are presented over it, the user's
swipe down taking the top one away. The application's `MenuBar` is the
iPad's main menu.

## Controls, acts, and events registered in Swift

An application extends the host from its UIKit head. Registrations run before
`SwiftOmniUIUIKit.run`, on the main thread. Registering a contract or an act again
replaces the earlier registration.

**A host in the same process registers BY TYPE.** Every registration is
written against the same `ElementContract` the application's own views are
written against, so the compiler refuses a property of the wrong type, an
event of a contract the element does not wear, and a performer whose arguments
are not the act's. The application's contracts are `public`, for the host's
module to see them. The UIKit halves of the Gallery's own are in
`apps/Gallery/Platforms/UIKit/Host/`.

### A control

`SwiftOmniUIControls.add` says what an application's own element IS on screen:

```swift quote
public static func add<Realized: ElementContract, Made: UIView>(
    _ contract: Realized.Type,
    create: @escaping (UIKitReports<Realized>) -> Made,
    members: (UIKitRegistration<Realized, Made>) -> Void = { _ in })
```

- **`create`** makes the view once per element, and wires what the view
  reports: `reports.raise(Contract.member, values)` for an event of the
  element's own, and `reports.report(property, value, as: event)` for a value
  the USER changed - which lands on the state the value is carried in and
  raises the event with it.
- **`members`** registers what the view takes: `property(_:_:)` hands a value
  over as the type its contract declares, `nil` where it is no longer
  described, and `raises(_:)` records an event the view raises.

```swift quote
extension TrafficLightView {
    @MainActor
    static func register() {
        SwiftOmniUIControls.add(TrafficLightContract.self, create: { reports -> TrafficLightView in
            let light = TrafficLightView()
            light.onLampTapped = { index in
                reports.raise(TrafficLightContract.lampTapped, index)
            }
            return light
        }) { light in
            light.property(TrafficLightContract.signal) { view, signal in
                view.signal = (signal ?? .stop).rawValue
            }
            light.raises(TrafficLightContract.lampTapped)
        }
    }
}
```

The host asks a registered view how big it is with `sizeThatFits(_:)`, as
UIKit asks any view it lays out, so a view of the application's own answers
there. It keeps the view between renders by identity and applies the shared
view properties around it: margins, alignment, opacity, sizing, gestures,
focus, and frame reports. A registered view draws however it likes, the GPU
included: the Gallery's `Cube3D` is an `MTKView` drawing with Metal, and its
loop pauses in `didMoveToWindow` once no window shows it. A registered element
is a leaf here: its children reach nothing.

### An act

`SwiftOmniUIActs.add` registers a function the application calls by its act, and
`SwiftOmniUIActs.add(_:on:_:)` one aimed at the application's own element, handed
that element's view:

```swift quote
SwiftOmniUIActs.add(NotesContract.setClipboard) { text in
    UIPasteboard.general.string = text
}

SwiftOmniUIActs.add(RatingBarContract.flash, on: RatingBarView.self) { bar in
    bar.flash()
}
```

A performer runs on the main thread, takes the act's own types and answers
its own. A thrown error, an aim at nothing, and an act nobody registered each
fail the call with the reason, named. The Swift half is under
[Host-extension actions](../interface/interaction-and-actions.md#host-extension-actions).

### An event without a control

`SwiftOmniUIEvents.raise` pushes an event of the application's that belongs to no
element, and `SwiftOmniUIEvents.raises` declares it where its source is wired:

```swift quote
SwiftOmniUIEvents.raises(NotesContract.batteryChanged)

UIDevice.current.isBatteryMonitoringEnabled = true
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    forName: UIDevice.batteryLevelDidChangeNotification, object: nil, queue: .main
) { _ in
    SwiftOmniUIEvents.raise(NotesContract.batteryChanged, Double(UIDevice.current.batteryLevel))
}
```

`raise` is safe from any thread and answers how many subscriptions heard it; a
raise nobody hears is an ordinary zero. The Swift side subscribes with
`HostEvents.on`; see
[Host-extension events](../interface/interaction-and-actions.md#host-extension-events).

## Running

```bash
.scripts/UIKit/run-app.sh apps/HelloWorld debug "iPhone 18 Pro"
.scripts/UIKit/run-app.sh apps/Gallery debug "iPad Air 13-inch (M4)"
.scripts/UIKit/run-app.sh apps/Gallery debug "My iPhone"
```

`run-app.sh` builds the head, installs the application, starts it and follows
what it prints. Where it goes is a device's name, its identifier or its UDID,
or a simulator's name or UDID; with none named it is the simulator booted,
else an iPhone. A simulator is booted where it is not running and the
Simulator opened; a device is reached over USB or Wi-Fi, its build signed for
it. `--no-log` returns once the application has started. Everything a build
writes stays in the application's `.build-uikit/`.

In VS Code, choose **UIKit** as the host and an iPhone, an iPad or a
simulator, and press **F5**.

## Debugging

**SwiftOmniUI: Debug** runs the application as `run-app.sh --debugger` does and
attaches `lldb-dap` to it: a breakpoint in the application, in SwiftOmniUI or in
the host stops it from the first line, with its source, its stack and its
variables. `--debugger` starts the application held until a debugger
attaches, and writes where to `.build-uikit/debugger.json`: its process and,
on a device, the device and the bundle built, whose symbols the debugger
reads. A simulator's process is one of this Mac's; a device's is reached
through the device:

```bash
.scripts/UIKit/run-app.sh apps/Gallery debug "My iPhone" --no-log --debugger
lldb -o "device select <device from debugger.json>" \
     -o "device process attach --pid <process from debugger.json>"
```

Only a debug build can be debugged.

## Testing

A view exists only in an application's process, so the host's suite is an
application of tests, run in its own scene on a simulator:

```bash
.scripts/UIKit/test-uikit.sh "iPhone 18 Pro"
.scripts/UIKit/test-uikit.sh "iPad Air 13-inch (M4)"
SWIFTOMNIUI_FILTER=testSlider .scripts/UIKit/test-uikit.sh
```

Each test and each conformance case says as it ends where the run stands, and
the run ends with *Executed N tests, with M failures*. `SWIFTOMNIUI_FILTER` runs
the tests whose name holds one of its comma-separated names;
`SWIFTOMNIUI_UPDATE_EXPORTS=1` writes what the run says into `exports/` instead of
holding it to them. The suite runs with the simulator's accessibility off, as
a simulator starts.
