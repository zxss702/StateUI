# AppKit host

The AppKit host renders a SwiftOmniUI application with AppKit controls on macOS. It
runs in the same process as the application module and the library, and applies
the typed sparse patches of the [host contract](../internals/host-contract.md) directly.

It presents SwiftOmniUI's controls, arrangements and pages over the runtime every
host shares - the [platform contract](../platform-contract.md#control-creation) says
which, member by member - and shows any other control's name in red where the
control belongs, so a gap is visible rather than silent.

```text
lib/SwiftOmniUI.AppKit/
  Sources/    SwiftOmniUIAppKit: the renderer, windows, sessions and the registry
  Tests/      the host's suite
.scripts/AppKit/
  build-gallery-appkit.sh      the Gallery's bundle, in apps/Gallery/.build/appkit

  main.swift                   the application's AppKit head
  Host/                        what this host answers for the application
```

An application's AppKit head is `Platforms/AppKit/main.swift`. It registers the
application, says what this host answers for it, then starts the host:

```swift quote
import NotesUI
import SwiftOmniUIAppKit

swiftomniui_app_register()

// The controls this host realizes, the acts it performs, and the pushes it
// reports. Each lives in Host/ beside this file.
NotesControls.register()
NotesActs.register()
NotesEventSources.start()

SwiftOmniUIAppKit.run(resourceDirectory: resources, applicationIcon: icon)
```

The head finds its artwork from its own source file, `#filePath`, so it runs
the same whether a debugger, a task or a terminal starts it. The icon it hands
the host is `Resources/AppIcon/appicon_macos.svg`, drawn on macOS's icon grid:
a 1024-point canvas whose body is an 824-point rounded square 100 points in.
Artwork drawn edge to edge stands larger in the Dock than every icon beside
it.

Every AppKit build of an application defines the `APPKIT` compilation
condition; Swift written for this host alone stands under `#if APPKIT`. See
[Project structure and development](../development.md).

## Controls, acts, and events registered in Swift

An application extends the host from its AppKit head. Registrations run before
`SwiftOmniUIAppKit.run`, on the main thread. Registering a contract or an act again
replaces the earlier registration.

**A host in the same process registers BY TYPE.** Every registration is written
against the same `ElementContract` the application's own views are written
against, so the compiler refuses a property of the wrong type, an event of a
contract the element does not wear, and a performer whose arguments are not the
act's.

Because the registration names the contract's types, the application's
contracts are `public`: the host lives in a module of its own and must see
them. The Swift half itself is the same for every host - one contract, one
`View`. The AppKit halves are in `apps/Gallery/Platforms/AppKit/Host/`.

### A control

`SwiftOmniUIControls.add` says what an application's own element IS on screen:

```swift quote
public static func add<Realized: ElementContract, Made: NSView>(
    _ contract: Realized.Type,
    create: @escaping (AppKitReports<Realized>) -> Made,
    members: (AppKitRegistration<Realized, Made>) -> Void = { _ in })
```

- **`create`** makes the view once per element, and wires what the view
  reports: `reports.raise(Contract.member, values)` for an event of the
  element's own, and `reports.report(property, value, as: event)` for a value
  the USER changed - which lands on the state the value is carried in and
  raises the event with it.
- **`members`** registers what the view takes: `property(_:_:)` hands a value
  over as the type its contract declares, `nil` where it is no longer
  described, and `raises(_:)` records an event the view raises.

Name the view's own class where the closure makes it - `create: { reports ->
TrafficLightView in … }` - so every applier is handed that class rather than a
bare `NSView`.

```swift quote
SwiftOmniUIControls.add(TrafficLightContract.self, create: { reports -> TrafficLightView in
    let light = TrafficLightView()
    light.onLampTapped = { index in
        reports.raise(TrafficLightContract.lampTapped, index)
    }
    return light
}) { light in
    light.property(TrafficLightContract.signal) { view, signal in
        view.signal = (signal ?? .stop).rawValue
    }
    light.raises(TrafficLightContract.lampTapped)
}
```

Write a control's registration beside the view it registers: a `static func
register()` in an extension at the end of the view's own file. Everything
about the control - the view, what it reports, what it takes and the acts aimed
at it - is then read in one place, and the application's list of its controls
is only a list:

```swift quote
extension TrafficLightView {
    @MainActor
    static func register() {
        SwiftOmniUIControls.add(TrafficLightContract.self, create: { reports -> TrafficLightView in
            …
        }) { light in
            …
        }
    }
}

enum NotesControls {
    @MainActor
    static func register() {
        TrafficLightView.register()
        RatingBarView.register()
    }
}
```

The host keeps a registered view between renders by identity, and applies the
shared view properties around it: margins, alignment, opacity, sizing,
gestures, focus, and frame reports. A node type with no registration draws the
unsupported-control marker.

A Swift `Style` can target the control once its Swift struct conforms to
`StyleTarget`. Styles resolve on the Swift side, so the control arrives with
the style's values already among its own; the registration needs nothing for
it. A value handed over as a state - `.rating($stars)` over
`setValue(_:on:mode:kind:)` - reaches the same applier on the host's own
frames; see [Animation and journeys](../concepts/animation-and-journeys.md).

**A registered view draws however it likes, the GPU included.** An `MTKView` is
an `NSView`, so its registration says no more than any other one: the Gallery's
`Cube3D`, drawn here with Metal, takes a size, a colour and whether it turns, and the corners, the
matrix and the frames stay the host's. Two things belong to a view that runs a
loop of its own. It stops that loop when the tree drops it - the Gallery's
pauses in `viewDidMoveToWindow`, so nothing turns behind a page the user has
left. And a stopped loop still owes one frame to a value that changed, or a
size moved while it is paused arrives only when the user starts it again.

An element only some hosts can honestly realize is declared only for them.
`Cube3D`'s contract and its `View` stand under `#if APPKIT || GTK` beside its
sample - one declaration, drawn with Metal here and with OpenGL on GTK - so a
test reading an application's elements against another host's registrations
never demands of that host a control it cannot draw.

**A registered control has no slot on this host.** This host arranges
children by the container classes it makes itself, so a registered view is
handed none - a registered element's children reach nothing. An application's
own element is a leaf here.

### An act

`SwiftOmniUIActs.add` registers a function the application calls by its act:

```swift quote
public static func add<
    Owner: ApplicationTier, each Argument: HostRepresentable, each Answer: HostRepresentable
>(
    _ act: ElementAct<Owner, (repeat each Argument), (repeat each Answer)>,
    _ perform: @escaping @MainActor (repeat each Argument) throws -> (repeat each Answer))
```

```swift quote
SwiftOmniUIActs.add(NotesContract.setClipboard) { text in
    NSPasteboard.general.clearContents()
    NSPasteboard.general.setString(text, forType: .string)
}

SwiftOmniUIActs.add(NotesContract.batteryLevel) {
    battery()
}
```

An act AIMED at one of the application's own elements takes the view instead:
the aim puts the element's identity in argument 0, and this host turns it back
into the view its registration made.

```swift quote
SwiftOmniUIActs.add(RatingBarContract.flash, on: RatingBarView.self) { bar in
    bar.flash()
}
```

- **Where it runs.** A performer runs on the main thread, where AppKit draws.
- **Its values.** The arguments and the answer are the act's own types. A call
  carrying anything else fails with the reason rather than running on a guess.
- **Failure.** A thrown error fails the act: the awaiting Swift handler throws
  `SwiftOmniUIError` with the reason. An aim at nothing, or at an element no longer
  on screen, fails the same way.
- **Scope.** An act nobody registered fails with that reason, named.

The Swift half is under
[Host-extension actions](../interface/interaction-and-actions.md#host-extension-actions).

### An event without a control

`SwiftOmniUIEvents.raise` pushes an event of the application's that belongs to no
element, such as a power or network change:

```swift quote
@discardableResult
public nonisolated static func raise<Owner: ApplicationTier, each Value: HostRepresentable>(
    _ event: ElementEvent<Owner, (repeat each Value)>,
    _ value: repeat each Value) -> Int
```

```swift quote
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    forName: .NSProcessInfoPowerStateDidChange, object: nil, queue: nil
) { _ in
    SwiftOmniUIEvents.raise(
        NotesContract.lowPowerChanged, ProcessInfo.processInfo.isLowPowerModeEnabled)
}
```

`raise` is safe from any thread, so a source is wired where the platform
reports it. It answers how many subscriptions heard it: a raise nobody hears is
an ordinary zero rather than a failure, so an application wires its sources
unconditionally. The Swift side subscribes with `HostEvents.on`; see
[Host-extension events](../interface/interaction-and-actions.md#host-extension-events).

The head declares each event it raises where it wires the source, before
`SwiftOmniUIAppKit.run(resourceDirectory:applicationIcon:)`:

```swift quote
SwiftOmniUIEvents.raises(NotesContract.lowPowerChanged)
```

The host tells the core what it realizes when it starts: every element of the
library's it shows, the controls the application added, and the events
declared. A `HostEvents.on` for an event nothing declared is then said once -
*the host raises no `Notes.LowPowerChanged`: the handler will not hear it* -
with the declared names nearest to it; so is an element the host shows none
of, the first time it is described.
