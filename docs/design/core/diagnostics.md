# Diagnostics

Three instruments tell what the core is doing without changing it: the tally
of renders and live elements, the inspector's record of each render, and the
complaints a value the library cannot use leaves behind. `debugInfo()`, which
explains a single build in the author's names, is in invalidation.md.

## The tally

```text
  renders    how many renders this process made
  empty      how many carried no patch - a write that changed no property
  refused    how many writes asked for nothing, because no live element read
             the state (invalidation.md)
  alive      how many rendered elements are alive now
```

`empty` is how a write that should have asked for nothing is found; `refused`
is the other half, what counting live readers spared beside what got through.
`alive` is counted in as each rendered element is made and out as it goes, so a
page that was left and still stands in memory shows as a number that does not
come back down. It tells a leaked page from memory the allocator has not handed
back yet, which a process's resident size cannot. A host reads the tally
through `HostBoundary.tally` - a Swift runtime writes it with its own totals
under `SWIFTOMNIUI_TALLY=1` (host/patches.md) - and the per-cycle trace through
`HostBoundary.cycleTrace`, built only when the host's trace switch is on: this
side has no environment to read.

## The inspector

While an inspector records, the renderer opens a pass around every render and
the differ writes an entry for every composed view it reaches:

```text
  pass    road (walk, build, complete), causes in the author's names,
          microseconds describing, and the host's half: applying, per scene
          too, and the controls walked, made and kept
  entry   built  - with the reason it could not be carried
          carried - whole: not built, not compared, not sent
          walked  - only as the path to a view below it that was built
          each with its inclusive and its own time
```

Nothing runs while nobody looks: every hook in the differ is one read of
`recording`, false until an inspector opens, so an application that never opens
one pays a branch per composed view. A host that wants every pass as text
(`SWIFTOMNIUI_INSPECT=1`) asks for the log once, and recording then stays on.

The inspector is not its own subject. It is a tree like any other, built again
whenever a pass lands, so its own views are muted - their time is kept apart and
they write no entries - and a pass caused by nothing but its own state, or one
that built nothing but its own views, is not kept, whichever road it took.
Otherwise every pass would record the inspector drawing the pass before it,
and after a failed apply a complete render the inspector kept would ask it to
draw again, for good.

A pass keeps at most `most` entries, and the record keeps the last `kept`
passes; the host's report is matched to its pass by generation.

## Complaints

`complain` says, once, that a value an application handed the library was not
one it could use, and leaves whatever was used instead to the caller. A
complaint is never a refusal: every one is written beside a value that carries
on working, and nothing depends on one being read. It exists because the
alternative is silence - a value quietly held to what it can be, and an author
left wondering why the constant they wrote does nothing.

Each message is said once per process, because the places that complain are
modifiers, and a modifier runs on every render: an author who wrote 1.4 where a
fraction belongs would otherwise be told so as fast as the interface is
described. It goes to standard output, outside the lock: a terminal on macOS,
the console on iOS, a shell on Windows and Linux, and nowhere on Android, whose
process output is not routed. So a complaint is a development aid and may never
be the only thing between an application and working.
