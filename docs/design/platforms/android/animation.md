# Animation on Android

How the Android Views host moves what the core's animation elements say
([animation](../../host/animation.md)): which properties it draws on the way, how a
view is moved, turned and scaled, and when every animation arrives at once.
The frames come from the UI thread's choreographer ([runtime](runtime.md)).

## What moves

A host moves only a value it draws, so the Android Views host moves the host
layer's closed set ([what travels](../../host/animation.md#what-travels)),
element by element, with no exception of its own: every value in it reaches
Android's views on each frame - a view's opacity, background, sizes, padding
and planar transforms, a layout's box, the words' size and colour, a shape's
paint, a slider's value. Any other property arrives at its value at once,
rather than keeping an animation alive that nothing on screen would show.

A property's animation begins where the view stands: the opacity it is drawn
at, the value a slider's thumb shows. A thumb the user holds is where the
next animation of its value starts.

## Moved, turned and scaled

A view's translation, rotation and scale are the view's own properties on
Android, drawn over the place its layout gave it, so moving one never moves
the layout's arithmetic. A translation is in points and becomes pixels at the
display's density; rotations are in degrees, clockwise in the screen's plane,
and a positive turn about either axis in depth sends the top, or the right
edge, away - Android's own directions are SwiftOmniUI's. `scale` multiplies both
axes over `scaleX` and `scaleY`.

SwiftOmniUI's pivot is a fraction of the view's size; Android's is in pixels. At
the centre Android keeps the pivot there itself as the size changes; any other
pivot is put back in pixels each time the view is placed.

## Less animation

A user who turns the system's animations off - the animator duration scale
at zero, which `ValueAnimator.areAnimatorsEnabled()` reports - asks for less
animation, and SwiftOmniUI hears it so: every animation arrives at its destination
at once, and a journey's waiter hears it arrive.

## Joining and leaving

A stack is a travelling layout: when a patch reaches it, its children travel
to their new places ([layout animation](../../host/animation.md#layout-animation)).
Its places are set on the views in the display's frame, as the layout animation
follows the animator, and a layout pass Android runs meanwhile asks for the
same places and keeps the running animation. A label whose place travels is
laid out at the size it is bound for, its corner travelling: a `TextView`
breaks its words at its width, so at the widths the place passes through
words that fit the destination on one line would stand on two
([words at their destination](../../host/animation.md#words-at-their-destination)).

By the host layer's rule ([showing and
hiding](../../host/animation.md#showing-and-hiding)), a child that joins a
standing stack fades in while the others make room. A
child the tree hides fades out first, still holding its room, and only then
goes: the stack closes over it as over a row a patch removed. A child shown
again comes up from nothing, or, shown again on its way out, from where the
fade has reached. Under a layout that moves nothing, or with less animation, it
goes and comes at once.
