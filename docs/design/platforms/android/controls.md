# Controls on Android

How the Android Views host presents the controls a user changes - a switch, a
slider, a field - and hears what the user does to them. The value a control
carries belongs to a state; the host writes the control where the tree
changed that value and reports the user's change back
([patches](../../host/patches.md)).

## One listener a view

Android tells a view's owner what its user did through listener interfaces:
a click, a turn, a thumb moved, words typed, a Return. The Java layer has one
listener class for all of them, `SwiftOmniUIListener`, made for one view with that
view's number, which forwards each call to Swift by the number
([JNI](jni.md)). A view hands the same listener to every setter it needs, so a
field's typing and its Return reach the same Swift view.

## Nothing the program writes is heard

Every native write of an element - a patch applied, a display frame presented
- runs inside `ProgramWrite`. Android calls a switch's, a slider's and a
field's listener while the value is being set, so the listener's call during
that write is the write's echo, and the element reports nothing. A control
does not keep a flag of its own.

## A slider in steps

`SeekBar` moves in whole steps from zero. The host gives it ten thousand steps
across the range and turns a step into a value and back, so a value the user
reports has the range's ten-thousandth as its finest step. A new range keeps
the value the thumb stands at, inside the range, unless the tree wrote a new
value with it: a hand on the thumb is never argued with.

## A field and its words

A field reports all its words after every change, and a report comes back as
the value of the state it carries: the host writes the words only where they
differ from the field's own, so the render a keystroke causes leaves the
user's words and caret alone. Words the program writes put the caret after
them.

`maximumLength` counts characters, as the contract does. The field keeps the
first characters that fit and writes them back, as the program, when typing
goes past the bound.

A password field is a field whose input type hides what is typed. Android
resets the typeface when the input type changes, so the field puts its weight
back after it.

A text field, a search field and a text editor are one `EditText` of three
kinds. A search field is a field whose keyboard's return key is captioned for
a search; a text field's is the platform's until the tree names one. An
editor takes several lines, standing from its top, and Return starts a new
one. One that does not grow with its words is one line tall where nothing
gives it room, and scrolls within the room it is given; one that grows is as
tall as its lines.

## An editor a line tall

An editor that does not grow stands a line tall where the tree states no
height, whatever its words hold, and scrolls within that line. Android's text
layout gives the last of its lines the font's padding below it, so the first
of several lines stands lower than a line laid out alone: an editor limited to
one line would shrink as a second line arrives. The host measures such an
editor at a line alone - the font's full height, its padding included where
the view includes it, and the view's own padding - and a height the tree
states still wins.

## Return, once

A keyboard's action reaches the listener with no key event; a hardware Return
reaches it as the key goes down and again as it comes up. The listener
submits on the action and on the key going down, and takes the key's release
itself, so one Return is one submission.

## The background a view is made with

A button, a field, a switch and a slider draw their own background. A colour
the tree describes replaces it, and a colour the tree takes away gives back
the background the view was made with, read before the first change.

A background brings its own padding - the room a button's drawing leaves
around its words - and Android takes the view's padding from each new one. A
padding the tree describes is put back over it, so a button with a colour and
a padding keeps its room; one whose padding is taken away gives back the
padding it was made with.

## A layout does not delay a press

A layout that does not scroll tells its children to show a press at once.
Android's default holds a press back in case the touch becomes a scroll,
which makes a slider inside a layout wait for the finger to move before its
thumb follows.

## A tap on any view

A view with a tap handler is given the same listener a button has, and a
click on it is its tap: Android's own touch handling decides what a tap is,
and a drag that becomes a scroll is no tap. A view whose handler goes away is
no longer clickable, so it stops taking touches. A SwiftOmniUI layout that
ignores input takes no touch at all, and the touch goes to whatever stands
behind it.

## A label's words

A label's words are one text, or the runs its spans describe as the host
layer reads them (`textRuns`), laid down as one spanned text: each run in its
own colour, size, weight, background and decorations where it has its own.
A run's size is in points the user's font scale applies to, as the label's
is. The label's letter spacing is in points and Android counts it in the
text's own size, so it is worked out again whenever the size changes; a
run's own spacing is not drawn. A line that is
cut or truncated is one line and only a truncated one says so; otherwise the
label wraps, to at most as many lines as it allows. A stated width is the
width a view is measured at, so wrapped words are as tall as they will stand.

## A button's size

A button is as big as its words and its padding. Android's color scheme gives every
button a least size of its own - 88 by 48 density-independent pixels - which
would widen a short caption and push a row of buttons past a phone's edge;
the host takes that floor away as it makes the button, and a least size is
then the author's, `minimumWidth` and `minimumHeight`, as on every host. The
stepper's buttons keep a square of 48 points, the room a finger needs, as
the stepper's own choice.

## A button's look

A button says nothing of its look and keeps its color scheme's: a background with
its own pressed ripple. A fill, an outline or corners make it one shape -
the host's shape drawable - under Android's pressed ripple in the color scheme's
highlight colour, kept within the same shape, so a drawn button still
answers a finger as the platform's do. The shape dims while the button is
disabled, to the color scheme's `disabledAlpha`, and so do words in a colour the
tree gave, as the color scheme's own colours do.

An icon beside words is a compound drawable at the picture's own size,
before, after, above or below them, the icon spacing apart or the
platform's gap. With no words it stands alone in the middle of the button,
over its background, sized to the room inside the padding: fitted, as `.fit`
and `.fill` both say - a button has no covering scale - stretched, or at its
own size for `.center`. That size is worked out as the button is placed, and
sent again only when the room changes.

## A picker

A picker is Android's dropdown spinner. A spinner always shows one of its
rows, and SwiftOmniUI's choice may be none, so the first row is the title: the
closed field shows it, in the color scheme's hint colour, while nothing is chosen,
and the open list leaves it out; a choice is the row after its index. Android
tells a spinner's selection as it next measures or lays the spinner out -
the row it started on, then the program's - when the program's write is long
over, so the picker itself knows the row the program's choice stands on, and
a report of that row, or of the title's, is no change. The picker is given
its options where they changed and the choice only where the tree changed it
or them (`PickerChoices`): a new title leaves the user's choice standing.

The list opens on the user's tap, which is reported, or on `isOpen`, which
is not. It takes the window's focus while it shows, and the focus coming back
is the list closing - Android has no call for it. Nor does it let a program
close the list: `isOpen` set to false leaves it to the user.

## A day and a time

A date picker and a time picker are one field of the host's, showing the day
or the time in the user's locale - "D" and "d" the long and short day, "T" and
"t" the long and short time, which follows the user's choice of a 24-hour
clock, any other text a pattern - and opening the platform's own calendar or
clock, within the bounds the tree gave. The user's choice is written into the
field and reported; the program's day or time is only written. The dialog
opening on the user's tap and it closing are reported; the program opening or
closing it is not, and a field that leaves closes its dialog.

## Work under way

A progress bar is Android's horizontal bar, the share done in 10 000 steps.
An activity indicator is Android's turning bar: it is drawn only while it
runs, and keeps its room while it does not, so starting the work moves
nothing around it; hidden, it takes no room.

## A stepper

Android has no stepper, so the host builds one from its own buttons: one a
step down, one a step up, side by side, each off at its end of the range. A
step is the user's report, held in the range; the value the tree writes is
put where it said, within it.

## A web view

A WebView is Android's own web view, standing in a holder. Where its web
process dies - a crash, or the system reclaiming memory - Android leaves the
view unusable: the holder makes it again, blank, and the element hears the
process ended; a reload shows the page again. A navigation is reported as it
starts and as it ends, with why it happened - a new page, back, forward, a
reload, as the act that caused it said - and how it ended: an error on the
page itself makes it a failure, a timeout its own. A page crosses with the
name the view asks by, the name written first: written while a page loads,
Android leaves that page out of the history, and there is no way back to it. Whether there is a page
behind and ahead is said when it changes. A script runs in the page and
answers later, by ticket, with its value as text: a string as itself, none
for null, anything else as JSON writes it. The web view runs scripts and
keeps the page's storage, as a browser does, and lets go of its page and its
web process when its element leaves.

## The keyboard's focus

`focus` answers whether the view took the keyboard; a view laid out with no
room refuses it, as Android refuses it. A web view's page takes the keyboard,
not the frame holding it, so what hears the frame's focus hears the page's.

## What assistive technology meets

A view's accessibility crosses in one call: the name a test finds it by, the
words read for it in place of its own and the hint read after them, whether
it is a heading, and whether it - or it with everything in it - is met at
all. The name and the hint are the view's node's, written as the node is
made; the rest are the view's own. A view the element says nothing of is as
it is of itself: a text is met, a layout as Android decides, so its own
presence is read once, before the element first says. Android marks a
heading but not its level.

## Gestures

A view has one listener, and what its element listens for
(`MountedElement.hearing`) is told there from the touches and the hovering pointer the view
gets, in points, and heard by the host layer's rule (`MountedElement.hear`):
taps, a press dragged, a pinch, and the pointer. One tap is the view's click,
which keeps what a click brings; where more make one, the listener counts
quick taps near each other as Android measures a double tap - Android itself
counts no run past two - and tells each with its place in its run. A press is
told as it goes down, moves, lets go or is taken away, measured on the screen,
since a view that follows its drag moves where its own touches are measured;
it is a drag by the host layer's rule (`DragRecognition`) once it passes
Android's touch slop, and the listener, told so at once, takes the rest of the
touch - the view's own press and click are called off. A press of more than
one finger is no drag, as the host layer's hearing says. A swipe is the
drag's end, far enough, in a direction asked for - the host layer's too. A
view that listens for a drag or a pinch keeps its touch from a scroller around
it, so a drag that starts on it is its own. A pinch is Android's own: it
starts once Android tells it apart, takes the press away, scales from there,
and ends where it was last centred. A view with no handling of its own is
given the whole touch; a control keeps its own.

A view made of parts - a stepper's two buttons, a web view's page - would hand
its listener only what no part takes, so its gestures see the touches and the
hovering first, before the parts do (`SwiftOmniUIWatch`): a drag or a pinch under
way takes the rest of the touch from the parts, which are told it was called
off, and a touch no part takes stays the view's where its element listens.
