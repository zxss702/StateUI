# Drawing on Android

How the Android Views host paints what a view is drawn with rather than what
it holds: a shape and the brush that fills it, a layout's own box, a
child an engine places, and the application's pictures.

## A shape and its brush

A layout's own box, a ColorPicker and any background that is not one plain colour are
drawn by one drawable of the host's, `StateUIShapeDrawable`: a rectangle, a
rectangle with rounded corners, or an ellipse, filled with a brush and
outlined in one colour. The Swift host tells it every part as the host layer
reads a box ([a box](../../host/layout.md#a-box)) - the shape's kind, each
corner's width and height in pixels, the brush's kind, its stops' colours and
offsets and its whole geometry, the outline's colour and width - and it
builds the gradient for the bounds it is drawn at, so a gradient's points stay
in fractions of the thing painted, as
[brushes](../../types/brushes.md#geometry-in-fractions) says. A radial
gradient's reach is the host layer's circle, worked out in Swift for the size
the drawable is drawn at and told again as that size changes - whether Swift
or Android placed the view. A plain colour
stays the view's own colour background; a background cleared gives back the
one the view was made with.

A corner rounds no more than half the side it rounds within the outline,
so a radius wider than a short box rounds it in a quarter of an ellipse.
Swift fits the corners to the size its view is placed at, and again each
time that size changes; the drawable draws them as given. A view clipping
to the shape cuts with one radius, the top left corner's narrower way, as an
outline takes it.

## A layout's own box

A stack, a grid or a ZStack paints its own box. A plain colour with no
outline, shape or cut is the view's plain background, as on any view. An
outline, a shape or a cut gives the layout a shape drawable instead, made
the first time one is said: the background fills the shape, the outline is
drawn inside the bounds, half its width either side of the shape's edge
being inside, and never pushes a child in - that is the padding's work.
With `clipsContent` the view clips to the drawable's outline, so a picture in
a rounded card has rounded corners; without it nothing is cut, the shape
drawn all the same.

## A placed child

An engine's placement run stands each child of a ZStack at a
rectangle of its own and draws it moved, turned, scaled and faded about its
centre, over whatever the child's own properties say. Android keeps one
translation, rotation and scale per view, so the host composes the two:
rotations add, scales multiply, and the view's own translation is turned and
scaled by the placement's before the placement's is added. That is exact
while the scales are the same on both axes, which is what a placement draws.
The opacities multiply, and the view's own opacity is still what its
animations start from.

A higher rank is drawn over a lower one because the layout draws its
children in that order, back to front, which is also the order a touch
reaches them in; nothing is moved in the group, so nothing is laid out again
for it. The order is set when a run or the children change, never while
Android lays the layout out. A run that follows another stands its children
at once, without laying out anything around the layout: its places need no
room. The shade a placed layout lays over a card is the holder's
second child, drawn at the run's shade.

## Pictures

A picture crosses as a file name, and the files are the application's
`Resources/Images`. Android draws no SVG, so the build draws each SVG three
times over, in sRGB, as `<name>@3x.png`, and copies every other picture as it
is, into the APK's `images` assets; only what changed is drawn again. At run
time a name finds its drawing three times over first, then a file of its
own name, which is kept at one pixel a point.

An image is measured at its picture's own size in points, read from the
file's header alone: the size is at the display's density, and Android's own
measure would scale it a second time. The four aspects are Android's four
scale types, and an image cuts what it draws to its bounds, since a StateUI
layout does not. A picture is read, measured and drawn at the host's own
density: its drawable targets that density, where Android's would take the
system's.

A picture's pixels are read when its view is placed, at the fewest the view
needs: one pixel in two, four, up to sixteen across and down, while that
still covers the view, scaled to the display's density as it is read. A card
showing a picture three times smaller than it was drawn holds a quarter of
its pixels, in memory and on the GPU alike. A StateUI layout measures a
height it has not settled yet, so the size a view is placed at is the one
that decides; a size given whole by a parent of Android's decides as well.
The bitmap says the density a whole one would have, so Android draws it at
the picture's own size. It is read again only for more pixels, never for
fewer, so a size in animation does not read it every frame, and a picture
shown centred, at its own size, is read whole. Views showing the same
picture at the same thinning share one bitmap, and the last to leave lets it
go; only a bar's and a tab's icons are kept for as long as the host runs.

A colour box has nothing to show but its colour: it takes the room its layout
gives it and asks for none of its own.

## Shapes

A shape is one view of the host's, drawn on its own canvas: a rectangle or an
ellipse fills the view, inset by half its outline so the outline stays
inside, and is moved by its render transform; a line, a path, a polygon or a
polyline is its own geometry, placed in the view by the host layer's rule
([a shape's own geometry](../../host/layout.md#a-shapes-own-geometry)) from
the bounds Android measures it at, then moved by the transform. Swift works
the six numbers out each time the room changes, and the view draws by them.
A path's arcs come as the shared parser's cubic curves. The geometry crosses
as one array of commands in pixels, and the brush, the outline, a
rectangle's corners - fitted as a box's are - and the six numbers one call
each. The fill is the brush
every shape of the host's paints with; the outline is a colour - a gradient's
first - and its dashes count in the outline's width, as StateUI's do. A
shape asks for no room of its own.

## A canvas

A canvas is one view of the host's that replays the drawing's instructions on
its own canvas, in the order they were written, inside its bounds, in points:
the canvas is scaled once by the display's density. The whole drawing
crosses in one call - each instruction's kind, colours, flags and the index
of its text as ints, its numbers as floats, its text as strings - so a
drawing of a thousand instructions is one crossing, not a thousand. The three
lists are the host layer's
([three lists for a relay](../../types/drawing.md#three-lists-for-a-relay)):
a record that does not read whole is left out, as every host leaves it out,
and a path's arcs and an arc of an ellipse come as the curves they run along,
so a whole turn fills the whole oval. Text wraps within its rectangle, stands across and down it as the
instruction says, and is cut at its edges. A finger's press, drag and release
come back in points; the canvas asks for no room of its own.
