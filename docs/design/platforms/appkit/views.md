# Views on AppKit

What the AppKit half's views are given by the host rather than finding for
themselves.

## Pictures

What crosses the boundary for a picture is a name, and the files behind it
belong to the renderer: it knows the application's resource directory and
keeps the cache over it, so one name is loaded once however many views draw
it. A registration is made once for the whole process and has no renderer to
ask, so the host hands every view it makes, through `AppKitPictureResolving`,
the means to resolve a name. A name the application has no file for resolves
to nothing.

## Accessibility on the control

A host view that wraps one native control hands assistive technology that
control in its own place, through `AppKitAccessibilityPresenting`. The
author's words, the role and whether the element takes part are written where
VoiceOver meets the control, not on the view around it.

## A stated size

A size the tree states for a view - its width, height and bounds - is what
SwiftOmniUI's layouts measure and place it by; the view also carries it as a
constraint, for a measurement of AppKit's own to read. That constraint stands
just short of required: a layout of SwiftOmniUI's places the view by its frame,
whose constraints stand over it until the first layout gives that frame,
and two required answers to one width are a conflict AppKit reports.

## A layout's own box

A stack, a grid or a ZStack paints its own box. A plain colour on a plain
rectangle is its layer's background colour: the view draws nothing and keeps
no backing store, which is what almost every layout is. An outline, a
rounded or oval shape, or a gradient makes the view draw instead - the
background on the shape, the outline inside the bounds, half its width either
side of the shape's edge, in a colour alone (AppKit's brush strokes no
gradient). With `clipsContent` the layer cuts what the layout holds: to its
bounds, its rounded corners, or an oval mask; without it nothing is cut.

A scroller's box is its layer's alone: a colour behind what it shows, a
colour's outline on a rectangle or a rounded one, and the cut of what it shows
to its shape, always. AppKit repaints a scroller's layer as it displays it and
clears its colour and outline, so the scroller puts them back each time it
updates its layer. An oval scroller cuts and draws no outline.

## Scroll bars

A ScrollView and an List lay their scroll bars over what they show,
whatever the Mac is set to show. SwiftOmniUI gives what they hold their whole
width - a list's item as wide as the list - and a bar standing beside it
takes 17 points of that: a Mac with a mouse and no trackpad shows its bars
always, beside the content, and a hosted CI runner is such a Mac. The style
is set before the scroll view first lays out; set later, its clip keeps the
narrower width until it lays out again. To see the runner's bars on a
desktop, run the suite after `defaults write com.apple.dt.xctest.tool
AppleShowScrollBars Always`, and delete that key afterwards.

## A radio button's set

SwiftOmniUI owns a radio button's set - its name, across the whole window - and
turns the others of a set off as one is checked. AppKit keeps sets of its own:
the radio buttons of one superview sharing one action turn each other off as
one is clicked, whatever sets SwiftOmniUI put them in. So the host's radio button
takes a turn only from SwiftOmniUI's own writes and from a click on itself, which
its cell makes; AppKit's turning off of the others is refused.
## A web view

A WebView is WebKit's own web view, as on UIKit
([the host layer's web rules](../../host/web.md)): a page at an address is
loaded; a document written in place with an address of its own is shown
there, and one with none is gone to as a `data:` address. What the page does
comes back as the element's events - a navigation as it starts, with why, and
as it ends, with how; the way back and forward said as a navigation commits
and ends, only a flag that changed; its web process dying. A step back,
forward or a load again the program asks for carries that as its cause; a
page still coming is asked for again. macOS's WebKit also declares a legacy
`WebHistory` class, so the host names the host layer's `SwiftOmniUIHost.WebHistory`
in full.
