# Input on AppKit

How the AppKit half meets the user's hand: which view a click reaches, where
the keyboard focus is, and how a scroller's movement reaches the core. The
platform owns each gesture; the host only says what SwiftOmniUI needs to know.

## Hit testing

AppKit finds the deepest native view under a point through `hitTest(_:)`.
SwiftOmniUI's input transparency is decided there, by `AppKitHitTestView`, the
surface every SwiftOmniUI container stands on. A transparent layout removes its
whole subtree from the search; with cascading off, it removes only itself and
keeps its interactive children reachable.

A native control - a button, a field, a slider - is no such surface, and
AppKit holds no flag on a view that takes it out of the search. So a control
that ignores input is kept in a weak set, and the layout holding it, finding a
point inside it, passes over it to what stands behind it: its other children,
or the layout itself.

An element that answers a tap is pressed by assistive technology too: its
press action runs the same handler a click runs, so VoiceOver and automation
reach it through the native accessibility press rather than a synthetic
click.

## The first click

An element that answers a tap takes the first click into an inactive window,
as a native control does, so a row opens wherever it is clicked rather than
only on its text. An element that answers nothing leaves that click to
activate the window.

## Focus

The keyboard focus is the platform's. It moves on a click, a Tab, a Return
and whenever AppKit takes it away, so SwiftOmniUI never mirrors it as state. The
host needs two answers, and asks the window for both at the moment they
matter:

- which view inside an element takes the keyboard: the element's view where it
  does, or the first view within it that does - a text field's own field, not
  the box it stands in;
- whether a window's first responder is inside an element. A text field's
  field editor is a separate view the window lends the field, so it counts as
  the field it edits.

## Scrolling

The scrolling is the platform's, and the host layer's `ScrollMovement` says
where a movement went and when it is over
([a scroller's movement](../../host/runtime.md#a-scrollers-movement)). AppKit
tells it a live scroll's beginning and end - the end with its momentum run
out, so the movement rests there - and every move of the clip view.

```text
  AppKit moves the clip view            (inside its own frame step)
        |
        v
  ScrollMovement.userMoved              joins the move before it: one move
        |                               per frame, from where it began
        v
  the display's next frame              frame(now:) hands the reports over:
        |                               moved(from:to:), then rested
        v
  the scroll view's element             the offset state and the events
```

A wheel's click is a movement no live scroll brackets, and rests once the
offset has stood still.

The offset is written to the scroller only where the tree moved it: the
user's own scrolling comes back as the state it wrote, and putting the clip
view back where it already stands would interrupt the platform's scroll
mid-gesture.

## What the user does

What the user does with the pointer and the trackpad AppKit's own recognizers
hear, and each tells the host layer what it heard - never an event: a click
with its place in a quick run of clicks, a press dragged with its phase and
how far it has come, a pinch's step, the pointer's coming, moving, pressing,
letting go and leaving - each measured from the view's top left, as every
host measures it. Which of them an element listens for, how many clicks make
its tap, the states a drag carries and whether a drag that ended was a swipe
are the host layer's (`MountedElement.hearing`, `hear`). AppKit drags with one
pointer: an element asking a pan of more gets no drag recognizer.

## Where a view stands

A view whose frame the tree reads is followed by the host layer
(`FrameFollowers`): AppKit tells it only that something moved - the view, or
any ancestor up to its window's content, watched through their frame and
bounds notifications, a scroller's clip among them - and the host layer asks
each follower on the display's next frame, in the order they were made, as one
of the user's transactions. The view says its place in its parent, its corner
in its window and from the window's content, each from the top left. It says
nothing while it stands in no window or before a layout placed it - SwiftOmniUI's,
or AppKit's giving it a size: a view that joins a shown page meets a display
frame before its layout, and its first report is where it is laid out.
