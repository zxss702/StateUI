# Input on GTK

How the GTK host hears what the user does to an element with a finger, a pen
or the mouse - a tap, the pointer, a press dragged, a pinch - and reports it
as the element's events ([a user's change](../../host/runtime.md#a-users-change)).
A control's own input - a button's click, a switch turned - is the control's,
and stays there ([controls](controls.md)).

## Listening

A view listens only for what its element's handlers and channels ask: taps
for a tap handler, the pointer for a pointer handler, a press dragged for a
pan, a swipe or a state a pan carries, a pinch for a pinch handler. Each kind
is a GTK event controller on the view's widget, added when the view starts
listening for it and removed when it stops, and every controller's signals
name the view by its number. A view that leaves the tree stops listening
first, so its widget holds none of them.

GTK hits a widget across its bounds, whatever it draws: a panel with nothing
between its children still takes a click there, so a row answers past its
words as well as on them. GTK tries a widget's children before the widget
itself, so a layout that lets input through - a panel whose own test of a
point holds none - passes a click beside its children on to what is under
it, while its children still take theirs. A view that ignores input takes
none, nor does anything in it.

## Taps

A tap is `GtkGestureClick`'s release of the primary button, or of a finger,
over the view, of a press that has not moved past GTK's drag threshold. GTK
counts a quick run itself - the release's place in it - by the desktop's
double-click time and distance; a view asking for `count` taps answers each
time the run reaches a multiple of it.

GTK stops counting a press as a click when it moves past the drag threshold,
and also when it is held past the double-click time, and it still tells the
release after either. The host takes the stop as a move only where the press
now stands past the threshold from where it went down, so a slow click is
still a tap.

The tap claims its press, and GTK denies it to every view around the one
tapped: a tappable row inside another answers alone.

## Pressed by assistive technology

A panel carries one action, `panel.click`, enabled only while it listens for
taps. GTK offers a widget's enabled actions to assistive technology through
AT-SPI, and pressing it runs the tap handler once, whatever count the view
asks for - as a screen reader's press, and a test's, do.

## The pointer

The pointer's entering, moving and leaving are `GtkEventControllerMotion`'s,
in the view's coordinates. Its press and its release are a drag gesture of
any button, followed to its end however far it goes: pressed where it went
down, released where it was let go. That gesture stands in one group with a
pan's on the same view, so the pan claiming the press does not end the
pointer's.

## A press dragged

A press of the primary button, or a finger, becomes a drag by the host
layer's rule ([a press dragged](../../host/runtime.md#a-press-dragged)) once
it has moved past GTK's drag threshold along either axis - the distance
GTK's own click stops at, which also tells a press that moved from a tap. From there
the drag claims its press: GTK denies it to the tap on the same press and to
every view around the one dragged, so a view dragged inside another drags
alone. It is measured on the window, from each event's own position, where
the view it moves does not move the measure. A drag says its phases - began,
moved by how far since it began, ended or cancelled - and a pan's states move
by that from where they stood as it began. It ended when the last event it
followed let go of the press; otherwise it was cancelled. Ended, it is a
swipe by the host layer's rule ([a swipe](../../host/runtime.md#a-swipe)). A
pan that asks for more than one pointer is not recognized.

## A pinch

A view that listens for a pinch takes `GtkGestureZoom` - two fingers on a
touch screen, or a touchpad's pinch - and says each step's scale since the
last, and where, as shares of its size. The pinch claims its fingers as it
begins, which keeps a scroller around the view from panning with them.
## The keyboard's focus

A view whose element hears its focus change takes `GtkEventControllerFocus`,
and reports its `enter` as the keyboard coming and its `leave` as the
keyboard going. Both name the focus within the widget or any part of it: a
field's inner text widget taking the keyboard is the field taking it, and
the keyboard moving between a control's own parts tells nothing. A widget
GTK gives no keyboard focus - a label, a box, a picture - never takes it,
whoever asks, so its element hears nothing; the act that puts the keyboard
on it answers that it did not.
