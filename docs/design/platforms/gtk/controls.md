# Controls on GTK

How the GTK host presents the controls a user changes - a switch, a slider, a
field - and hears what the user does to them. The value a control carries
belongs to a state; the host writes the control where the tree changed that
value and reports the user's change back ([patches](../../host/patches.md)).

## Words

A label's words are a `GtkLabel`'s, and how they look is one list of Pango
attributes written whole whenever any of it changes: the font's size in
logical pixels, its weight, slant and family, the colour, the space between
the letters, a line's height as a multiple of the font's own, and the lines
under or through the words - each GTK's own where the tree says nothing.

A label wraps at word boundaries, breaking a word only where it alone is
wider than the label, or at any character, on as many lines as it is allowed,
the last cut short with an ellipsis; cut short where the tree asks, it keeps
one line, however many it is allowed ([runs of words](../../host/tree.md#runs-of-words)), and shows
the ellipsis at its start, middle or end. Its lines stand
from its leading edge, in its middle or at its trailing edge, which GTK turns
over for a language written from the right, and at its top unless the tree
stands them in its middle or at its bottom - GTK's own is the middle.

A label's padding is room inside its own box, around its words
([a widget's own box](drawing.md#a-widgets-own-box)), and its background a
class filling that box in its colour - a brush's first colour. A button's caption is
the `GtkLabel` the button shows it in, and takes the same look, font and
colour, and the button its padding.

## A button's box

A button the tree gives a fill, an outline or a shape wears a class of the
host's style sheet drawing them - the fill as its background, the outline as
its border, the shape as its corners' radius, an ellipse as round ends - and
what the tree says nothing of stays the color scheme's. The sheet stands above the
color scheme, so its fill would stand under the pointer and pressed too: the class
draws the fill a little fainter under the pointer and fainter again pressed,
as the color scheme's own buttons answer.

## Runs of words

A label's spans are its words, run by run: the label's text is their words
joined, and each run's look - its colour, size, weight, slant, lines and
background - covers its own bytes of it, the label's look where the run says
nothing. The runs stand in place of the label's own words; a label whose
spans are taken away shows its own words again. A span that changes has its
label apply again, so the runs are laid down whole each time.

## On or off

A Switch is GTK's `GtkSwitch`, a CheckBox and a RadioButton each a
`GtkCheckButton`, one view kind in the host: whether it is on, whether it can
be turned, and the turn the user makes, each heard through the property GTK
notifies. A check box has no caption, so it is the box alone; a radio
button's caption is its label, in the look the tree gives its words.

Which of a radio button's set loses its check is the host's. A set is named
across the window, or is the buttons beside one that names none, and only
the tree knows who is in it: the button the user checks reports that it is
on, and the host takes the check off each other button of its set, each
reporting that it is off, in one transaction. GTK draws a check button as a
radio only in a group, and a group takes its other members' checks away
itself - the one that lost would be heard twice - so each radio button stands
in a group with a partner of its own that is never shown.

## Nothing the program writes is heard

Every native write of an element - a patch applied, a display frame presented
- runs inside `ProgramWrite`. GTK tells of a change inside the call that makes
it: a `GtkSwitch`'s `active` notice, a `GtkScale`'s `value-changed`, a
`GtkEntry`'s `changed` come from the host's own setter as from the user's
hand. A report during the program's write is the write's echo, and the
element reports nothing. A control keeps no flag of its own.

## A slider and its range

A slider is a horizontal `GtkScale` that draws no number. A scale rounds the
value the hand sets to its digits; the host asks for no rounding, so the
value reported is where the thumb stands. The keyboard's step is a hundredth
of the range, a page a tenth. A new range keeps the value the thumb stands
at, inside the range, unless the tree wrote a new value with it: a hand on the
thumb is never argued with.

## A stepper

A stepper is a `GtkSpinButton`: its number, which the user can also type,
the buttons beside it and the arrow keys moving it a step, Page Up ten. The
number is written with as many decimals as the step, the range and the value
take ([a value in a range](../../host/runtime.md#a-value-in-a-range)), and the
value is kept inside the range; a number typed past an end stands at that
end.

The box reads its words as GTK does, with `g_strtod`, from its own `input`
handler. GTK's own reading takes empty words for 0 and, under the update
policy that keeps the value inside the range, puts words that say no number
at the range's lower end. The handler answers with the number the box stands
at instead, so such words leave it where it was, heard by nobody, and GTK
writes it back into the box.

## A field and its words

A field is a `GtkEntry`. It reports all its words from `changed`, which GTK
raises once for each change - a key, a paste, or a program's write. A report
comes back as the value of the state it carries: the host writes the words
only where they differ from the field's own, so the render a keystroke causes
leaves the user's words and caret alone. Words the program writes put the
caret after them.

`maximumLength` is the entry's own bound, in characters, as the contract
counts them: GTK keeps the first characters that fit, from a key, a paste and
a program's write alike.

A field submits when Enter is pressed in it, through the entry's `activate`.
A test types by writing the entry's words outside a program's write, which
GTK reports as it reports the user's.

A field's words stand in its `GtkText`, the text widget a `GtkEntry` and a
`GtkSearchEntry` both hold, so the two are one view. How the words are taken
is the tree's where it says so and GTK's where it does not: read only, and
what the input method is told - spell checked or not, the next word
suggested, and what the words are for, as GTK's input hints and purpose.
GTK's text widgets mark no spelling themselves; the input method is what
checks. A password field hides each character behind a dot. The words stand
across the field as their alignment says, and the caret and the selection are
put where the tree put them, in the characters GTK counts, only where the
tree changed them: the caret at the selection's end, as GTK selects.

A field's font and colour are a class of the display-wide sheet
([a widget's own box](drawing.md#a-widgets-own-box)) rather than Pango
attributes, since an editor's text view takes none: the class sets the font
and the colour, which the placeholder takes too. GTK dims a placeholder with
opacity; a placeholder colour is drawn in full.

## An editor

A TextEditor is a `GtkTextView` whose Enter starts a new line and submits
nothing, its words wrapped, in a scrolled window drawn as an entry is - filled
faintly, its corners rounded, ringed while it holds the focus - with an
entry's room around its words. It is as wide as the room it is offered, its
words wrapping in it; growing with its words it is as tall as they are, and
not growing it keeps a line's height, whatever it holds - the room its
layout gives it is the room it scrolls in. GTK allows a scrolled window no
less than its scrollbar's length, so an editor is never shorter than that.

A text view has no placeholder: the editor's is a label laid over its first
line, shown only while it holds no words. A text view has no bound either:
words going in past the editor's bound are cut in the buffer's `insert-text`
to the first that fit, as a field's text cuts them, from a key, a paste and a
program's write alike - so the words are never changed from inside the
buffer's own `changed`, where GTK still holds its iterators.

## A search field

A SearchField is a `GtkSearchEntry` - its search icon and a button clearing
it - taking its words as a field does; Enter submits it.

## Pictures

An Image is a panel of the host's showing a picture from the application's
folder ([the application's pictures](drawing.md#the-applications-pictures)),
its own size, whatever room its layout offers: an SVG the size it declares,
a bitmap its pixels, both as gdk-pixbuf reads them from the file.

The panel draws the picture in the place its layout gives it, as the aspect
says - whole in its room, covering it, stretched across it, or at its own
size in the middle - cut at the room's edge. A bitmap is read once. An SVG is
read at the size it shows at, at the display's scale, and again only for more
pixels, so a size in animation does not read it every frame. An SVG keeps its
own proportions as it is read, leaving bands where the room has others, so a
stretched one is read covering its room and drawn squeezed into it - never
enlarged.

## A picker

A Picker is a `GtkDropDown` over a `GtkStringList` of its choices' words, the
chosen one shown on its button. The chosen one is written only where the tree
changed it or the choices changed, so the user's choice is never argued with,
and the user's choice is reported onto the state it is carried in. GTK gives a
drop-down no placeholder and no way to open or close its list from outside, so
the title and the list's opening and closing are not realized.

## What shows work

A progress bar is a `GtkProgressBar` over the range 0 to 1, a fraction past
either end standing at that end; an activity indicator is a `GtkSpinner`,
turning while its work runs and drawing nothing while it does not. A tint is
a class of the display-wide sheet ([a widget's own box](drawing.md#a-widgets-own-box)):
the bar's done part - its trough's `progress` - takes it as its background,
the spinner as its colour.

## What assistive technology meets

What an element says for assistive technology is the host layer's
([what assistive technology meets](../../host/tree.md#what-assistive-technology-meets));
the host puts it on the widget as GTK's accessible label and description,
reset where the element says nothing so a widget's own words stand. A heading
takes GTK's heading role with its level. GTK fixes a widget's role once
assistive technology has met it, so a widget becomes a heading only while it
stands in no window - as the element's first properties find it - and a GTK
widget in a role other than its own is not named by the words it shows, so a
heading's label is its words, written again as they change.

GTK 4.14 gives assistive technology no identifier for a widget: its
`AccessibleId` is empty for every one, a builder's id and a widget's name
alike. A hidden state leaves out the element itself and passes its children
up to its parent, which is what a hidden element asks; an element left out
with its children needs every widget under it hidden too.

A word said to a screen reader goes through the window's accessible, and only
where its context is GTK's AT-SPI one: without the accessibility bus GTK
stands a context of no assistive technology, which GTK 4.14 announces through
a call it lacks - the process dies. There no one listens, and the act is
answered all the same.
