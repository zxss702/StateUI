# The relay

Swift does not call WinRT's own interfaces. Beneath the WinUI host stands a
C++/WinRT relay, the package's C++ target `CSwiftOmniUIWinUI`, behind plain C
functions its header declares - one set per family of controls, so the host
and the relay are each held to the types by their own compiler. SwiftPM
compiles it as C++20 over the projection `tools.ps1` generates; it links into
the host's library.

The relay holds only what Swift cannot do: WinUI's subclasses - the
application and the panel every layout is - the events, the post onto the UI
thread's queue, the frame's event, and what a test reads of the screen. Measured on the first probe, a call
from Swift into C costs a nanosecond, and a setter through the relay a few
hundred more than the same setter in C++: the crossing is nothing next to the
work it asks for.

## The C surface

A handle is a WinRT object's default interface, `AddRef`'d, which the host
lets go of with `swiftomniui_winui_release`. A handle is read back as the type it
was made as with no `QueryInterface`, or as any of its interfaces with one.
No C++ exception leaves a function of the relay: each catches whatever its
body throws - WinUI's, the standard library's, any other - says what failed
and why on standard error (`report`, which names each kind), and answers
nothing, false or 0, leaving the object as it was. An exception crossing the
C boundary ends the process where nobody can say why; a guard reads every
function of the relay for its catch (`testNoCppExceptionLeavesTheRelay`).

## The callbacks

The host hands the relay one table of functions, which the relay calls on the
UI thread: WinUI stands, a turn landed, a frame, a panel's measure and
arrange, a click, a switch's turn, a slider's move, a field's words and its
Return. Every one is set - the relay calls them unchecked, and an
empty one is a jump to nothing.

## A view and its number

The relay knows a view by the number the host gave it when it made the
element, and calls back with that number; the host finds the live view by it,
and a view that has left answers nothing.

## What a test reads

The relay keeps one reader for tests: `swiftomniui_winui_read(element, name)`
answers what WinUI holds of the element's property of that name, as words - a
colour as #AARRGGBB, a number, 0 or 1, sides and corners as four numbers - or
-1 for a property the element has none of. Beside it, `swiftomniui_winui_question`
reads the dialog showing over a window and `swiftomniui_winui_announced` what the
relay told the screen reader, which WinUI keeps nowhere a test can ask. A test
reads the control; it never asks the host what it wrote.
