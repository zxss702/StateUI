# The runtime

A runtime is the part of a host that turns the core's patches and cycles into
native views, and turns what the user does back into state. Every runtime has
the same elements, one job each, named alike in every language. The
toolkit-neutral elements are the host layer, `lib/SwiftOmniUI.Host` - the module
`SwiftOmniUIHost`, which reaches the core through `@_spi(Host)` - and every host,
Swift in the application's process, uses them as they are. Its folders are
its parts; [the host layer](../../internals/host-layer.md) maps them.

## The layers

```text
  application              views, @State, handlers, engines
       |
       v
  SwiftOmniUI core             state, keys, diffing, timing laws        lib/SwiftOmniUI/Sources
       |                   HostRender / HostPatch (typed)
       v
  host layer               CoreLink        PatchIntake
  SwiftOmniUIHost             MountedTree     MountedElement
  lib/SwiftOmniUI.Host         Animator        StateChannels
                           DescribedMotion LayoutMotion
                           DisplayCycle    ProgramWrite
                           Pump            HandlerDispatch
       |
       v
  toolkit half             frame signal, each element's native half,
  one package per host     realizations, layout views, scrolling, gestures,
  (lib/SwiftOmniUI.AppKit,     focus, accessibility, windows and menus
  lib/SwiftOmniUI.Android,
  lib/SwiftOmniUI.WinUI,
  lib/SwiftOmniUI.GTK)
       |
       v
  native views
```

A host links the core's dynamic library and takes the typed patch, so one
process holds one copy of SwiftOmniUI's types.

## The parts

Every element serves one part of the core's model: one `@State`, two reactive
paths, the journey's animations and the frame they run on.

| Part | What it is | Elements | Home |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S | one `@State` is one state channel, shared by every control bound to it | `StateChannels` | host layer |
| D | reactive path 1: a body rebuilds, is diffed, arrives as a patch | `PatchIntake`, `MountedTree`, `MountedElement`, `DescribedMotion`, `LayoutMotion` | host layer |
| | | `HandlerDispatch` | host layer |
| | | each element's native half (`NativeElement`), one realization per control family | toolkit half |
| C | reactive path 2: a value reaches a native control with no rebuild, and the user's change comes back | `ProgramWrite` | host layer |
| | | a user's change carried onto its state and its event, a radio set, a scroller's move (`MountedElement.reportUserChange`) | host layer |
| | | the native callback that hears the user | toolkit half |
| J | a journey's animations, run by the host | `Animator`, `Animation`, `AnimationTarget`; the laws are `HostMotionLaw` in the core | host layer |
| E | the frame engines and animations run on | `DisplayCycle`; the `FrameClock` protocol | host layer |
| | | the frame signal: the toolkit's display link | toolkit half |
| P | presenting what D describes, reporting the user into C | the layout arithmetic: `StackArithmetic`, `GridArithmetic`, `ZStackArithmetic`, `SingleChildArithmetic`, `ScrollArithmetic`, `MeasurementCache` | host layer |
| | | the layout views, scrolling, gestures, drawing, focus, accessibility, windows, menus | toolkit half |
| B | transport and process | `CoreLink`; `Registry` is the core's | host layer |
| | | `Pump`; `HostRuntime` wires every part above | host layer |
| | | the doorbell's post, the act performer | toolkit half |

## One frame

The frame clock ticks only while something holds it. Each tick runs one
display cycle, in this order, in every runtime:

```text
  frame clock tick (now, in ms on one monotonic clock)
    |
    1  the user's reports since the last frame     committed as one batch
    2  Animator.advance(to: now)                   StateChannels, DescribedMotion and
                                                   LayoutMotion follow the animations;
                                                   the channels' reports reach the core
    3  CoreLink.cycle(now)                         engines and conversions run in the core;
                                                   StateChannels take the changes
    4  one walk of the mounted tree                each element's native setters once,
                                                   each changed parent arranged once,
                                                   after its children;
                                                   finished animations answer their waiters
    5  a render, when the core needs one
    6  the clock stays held while anything moves; it lets go only here
```

A user's own change drains steps 2 to 4 and 6 at once, so the followers and
the engines move on the user's frame.

In step 4 a backend only presents each element's moved values; what they ask
of the elements around it is decided once, for every host
(`MountedElement.presentFrame`): the element presents itself again; its
parent arranges again where a value that places it moved, or where it shows
no view of its own and is drawn by its parent's; and the window's chrome is
composed again where it shows what moved (`WindowChrome.follows`).

## One turn

A thread parked in `CoreLink.waitForWork()` wakes the UI thread whenever the
core has work: a job on `MainActor`, a cycle, a render or an act. The turn
always runs in the same order.

```text
  doorbell thread: CoreLink.waitForWork() returns
    |  posts one turn to the UI thread
    v
  pump:  run the jobs  ->  a pending cycle  ->  render  ->  acts
                                                  |
                                                  v
                          PatchIntake.take(root, generation)
                            ProgramWrite marks the writes, handlers wait
                            the mounted tree applies the patch
                            a drift: refused, and render(baseline: 0) once
                            the generation is claimed only when it went in whole
```

The acts come last, so an act lands on the interface its handler just changed.

`Pump` is that turn, once for every runtime. A toolkit gives it a
`TurnPresenter`: what a render changed around the tree - the windows, their
pages, their chrome - and the performer of an act. A turn asked for while one
runs runs when it ends; the handlers a render created run and the turn goes
round again; the handlers waiting in `HandlerDispatch` run, a phase rendered
before what comes after it, and the turn goes round again; only then the acts.

## The doorbell

The core rings when it has work a turn must take - a handler resumed off the
UI thread, a state an engine wrote. A host parks a thread of its own on the
core (`CoreLink.ringForever`) and posts a turn onto its UI thread each time the
core rings: AppKit onto the main queue, WinUI through its relay, GTK through
GLib, Android onto its looper. The turn itself is the `Pump`'s.

## The handlers' order

The application's handlers run in the order the user caused them, each on the
interface the last one left. `HandlerDispatch` holds a handler raised while a
patch applies - the tree is half old, half new until the patch is in - and
one raised inside the user's transaction, a gesture that changes two things at
once, such as a radio button turning one off and the next on. Both run in
their order once the hold is over. A turn asked for inside the transaction,
by a report that wrote a state, waits for it too: the two halves of one
gesture render together or not at all.

A page's or a window's phase - it showed, it went - is queued as a phase. It
is rendered before the handler after it runs, so an application watching the
phase sees each one.

## A user's change

```text
  a native callback: a slider moved, a field typed into
    |
    +-- inside ProgramWrite: the program's own echo, dropped
    |
    v
  StateChannels.take       the animation stops where the user holds the value
  every other control      bound to the state wears the value in the same walk
  CoreLink.report          the core has the value
  the display cycle        drains at once: followers and engines move now
    |
    v
  the handler runs, and reads the user's value already in the state
```

The carrying is the host layer's, the same on every host
(`MountedElement.reportUserChange`): what the program writes reports
nothing; a value becomes the state's - a journey a carried property's channel
takes, else a report - and then its event runs, or a turn renders what the
state changed where no handler listens. A radio button checked takes its
set's other checks away first, in one user's transaction: each peer turned off
on its own control as the program, then reporting that it is off. A host's
native callback hands the value on, and turns a peer's control off in its
toolkit's terms.

## The runtime's parts

`HostRuntime` builds the parts every host holds alike and wires them once: the
core's link, the patch's intake, the animator, the state channels and the two
motions, the display cycle on the host's frame clock, the mounted tree and the
pump - the clock's frames run the cycle, a layout animation or an animation
starting holds the clock. It is also every road a user's change takes in: a
dispatch, a user's transaction, a report through a bound state, a journey
taken, a gesture's value. A host gives it its frame clock and how an element's
native half is made, and presents a turn's and a frame's end.

## The host layer

The toolkit-neutral elements live once, in the core, because every Swift host
would otherwise carry its own copy of the same arithmetic and rules: the
mounted tree and its patches, the animations, the state channels, the property
and layout animations, the display cycle's order, the one mark of a program's
write, a scroller's movement, the patch intake and the line to the core - and
the windows, the pages, the layout, drawing, text and input rules, the acts
and the environment's words, which [the host layer](../../internals/host-layer.md) maps
part by part. A toolkit gives the layer
each element's native half through `NativeElement`, its frame signal through
`FrameClock`, presents a frame through `FramePresenter` and a turn through
`TurnPresenter`, and hands
`LayoutMotion` the views it places as `PlacedView`. The core suite tests them
on every platform the core builds on, and `RuntimeArchitectureTests` holds
every Swift runtime to them: only `Animator` samples a timing law, only
`DisplayCycle` advances the animator and runs the core's cycle, only `Pump`
renders and takes the acts, only `CoreLink`
calls into the core, only `ProgramWrite` marks a write, and no runtime type is
an engine or a channel other than a state's. [Animation](animation.md) gives the
reasons of the animator, the state channels, the described animation and the layout
animation; [patches](patches.md) those of the patch intake and the program write;
[the mounted tree](tree.md) those of the tree and its native halves;
[layout](layout.md) those of the layout arithmetic.

## Where a view stands

An element whose frame the tree reads - a state its frame drives, or a
handler of its changes - says where it stands on the display's next frame
after anything was laid out or moved: its place in its parent onto the
state, the whole report to its handler, and nothing where the report is the
one it last said (`MountedElement.reportFrame`). The runtime's
`FrameFollowers` keeps the frames coming while a scroller moves or has
something to say, or a frame read may have moved, and on each frame lets the
scrollers say what they did, then the elements where they stand, each in the
order its view was made, as one user's transaction. A host says only what its
toolkit knows: the numbers of the place. It says nothing while the view
stands in no window or before a layout placed it - a view that joins a shown
page meets a display frame before the layout pass that places it - so the
first report a handler hears is where the view is laid out, never zeros.

## A scroller's movement

The scrolling is the platform's: a drag, a throw, a wheel and a key move a
scroller under its toolkit's own physics, and nothing in a host aims,
shortens or corrects them. `ScrollMovement` adds what no toolkit says in one
shape: where a movement went, frame by frame, and when it is over.

Reports wait for the display's frame. A toolkit moves a scroller from inside
its own frame step, and a report rendered there would hold that frame; so a
move joins the move before it, and a frame says where the scroller went
rather than every step.

Rest is said once per movement, and only when the offset moved. While the
user holds the scroller - a live scroll, a finger down - it cannot rest. A
hold that ran its throw out itself, as a desktop's live scroll does, rests
as it ends; a finger let go leaves the scroller to throw on by itself, and
that, like a movement nobody held, rests once the offset has stood still for
`restAfter` of the frame clock's time. A hold that catches a throw carries
its movement on, so it still rests once. A moving scroller keeps the frames
coming, so the quiet is counted in the display's own time and a hand-wound
clock reproduces every rest.

## What the user does with a finger

What the user does to a view with a finger, a pen or the mouse becomes the
element's events by one rule on every host (`MountedElement.hearing`,
`hear`): a view listens for taps where a handler hears them, for the pointer,
for a press dragged where a pan, a swipe or a state a pan carries asks - one
pointer's alone - and for a pinch. A tap answers each time a quick run
reaches the count asked for, and at once for a press assistive technology
made; the pointer says where it is, but not as it enters or leaves; a press
dragged moves the states it carries by how far it has come from where they
stood as it began, in one user's transaction, and is a swipe as it ends far
enough ([a swipe](#a-swipe)); a pinch says each step's scale since the last
and where, as shares of the view (`PinchStep`). A host's toolkit hears the
input and says it as `HeardInput`.

## A press dragged

A host whose toolkit tells a press and its moves, and no drag of its own,
tells a drag by one rule (`DragRecognition`): the press is a drag once it
has moved MORE than the platform's distance from where it went down - along
either axis where the platform measures a rectangle, Windows and GTK, or any
way where it measures a radius, Android. It starts there, at nothing, and
then each move is the drag's, measured from where the press went down, until
the press lets go and it completes, or the platform takes the press away and
it is cancelled. A press that never became a drag ends with nothing. The
distance is the platform's, in DIPs; the toolkit holds the pointer once the
press is a drag, which the host asks for as the rule says so.

## A swipe

A host whose toolkit tells it a press and how far it has moved, and no swipe,
tells a swipe by one rule (`SwipeDirection.swiped`): the press went the one
way it moved most - across when it moved at least as far across as down - if
that movement reaches the view's threshold and the view listens for that way.
A way it does not listen for is no swipe, even where the press also moved far
along the other axis: the dominant way decides, never a second one.

## The environment

What a host reads of the machine it stands on is told to the core the same
way on every host: the locale as eight words - language, region, name, time
zone, a 24-hour clock, the week's first day from Sunday's 0, metric measures,
a language written right to left - the network as its access and a set of
bits for its connections, a battery as present or not, charging, on mains
or full, and a screen as landscape where it stands at least as wide as it is
tall, turned by quarters from its natural orientation - none on one that
turns with nothing. When any of it changes, one step
follows on every host (`HostRuntime.environmentChanged`): the core is told
what stands now, the tree follows the language's direction, and one turn
renders what it all changed.

## The application's phase

A toolkit tells what each window does - whether it stands off the screen,
minimized or hidden with the window it belongs to, and whether it is
activated - and whether the whole application is hidden, and every host
tells it on alike (`ApplicationLifecycle`, `HostRuntime.windowStateChanged`).
What it tells settles a turn later, with whatever else it tells in the same
one: a toolkit tells a window deactivated before it tells another activated,
and the two are one move, in which the application stays in use.

- The application is in use while one of its windows is activated, seen
  nowhere while it is hidden or none of its windows stands on the screen,
  else showing behind another application.
- The scene in front is the one whose window was activated last. Only
  another window's activation moves it; the application going behind another
  moves it nowhere. Of the windows staying when one goes, the one activated
  last is the one the user comes back to (`activatedLast`), for a host whose
  toolkit leaves that choice to it.
- A scene is activated while one of its windows is, stopped while the
  application is hidden or its main window is off the screen, else
  deactivated - so a tool window the user is in keeps its scene activated
  under a minimized main window.
- A window is stopped while it is off the screen - minimized, hidden with
  the application, or hidden by its scene - else activated or deactivated.
  One that stands again hears first that it resumed.
- A window that hides while another scene is in front
  (`hidesWhenInactive`) stands hidden while one is, and none hides before a
  scene first came to the front. A window that floats (`floatsOnTop`)
  floats while the application is in front, and sinks with it.

The core hears the phase, then each scene and window what moved for it -
what leaves first, then what is activated - each rendered before the next,
and the windows stand again where the scene in front or the floating moved.
They are heard in their turn, as a window's being made is, so a toolkit
telling a state in the middle of one - a window activated as the host shows
it - waits for it to end. What stands already tells nothing: a lifecycle is
a state, not a count of the toolkit's callbacks. As the application ends,
each scene's windows hear that they are going, then the scene.

## A window the user closes

A window the user closes hears that it is going, then its scene hears what
that means for it, each rendered before the next (`HostRuntime.userClosed`):
the scene's main window - one of no kind of its own - takes the scene with
it, so the scene hears that it is going too; a window of its own kind is one
of the scene's windows gone, and the scene hears that it closed, carrying the
window's key, which forgets the window and its session. A window the tree
closes tells nothing: the tree already knows.

## Acts

An act the application calls is answered on every host the same way: with
a reply carrying its values, or a failure carrying the reason - a caller
waiting on it throws that, and one nobody waits on goes to the host's log - so
no caller waits on an act nobody performs. An act aimed at a view names it by
its first argument, the element's own id or its number; one naming none, or
none on screen, fails with that reason (`MountedTree.aimed`). One performer
does this for every host (`HostActPerformer`): it reads each act, keeps the
questions in line, answers and fails; a host gives it its toolkit's part
(`ActToolkit`) - the clock and the zones, a question shown, a word to the
screen reader, the focus, a value kept - and nothing more.

## An application's own acts

An act the application performs itself on its host - one no control stands
behind, or one aimed at an element of its own - is registered by its member
and performed the same way on every host (`InteropActs`): handed the values
its contract declares, an aimed one also the control of the element its first
argument names, and answered once it returns, or failed with why - a call
carrying other values than its act declares, an element the host shows
otherwise, or what the performer threw. What a host adds is its toolkit's:
the control it hands an aimed act.

## Questions for the user

A question - an alert, a confirmation, a choice of actions, a prompt - is
read from its act the same way on every host (`HostQuestion`): its title and
message, the accepting caption ("OK" where it names none), the cancelling one
("Cancel" for a confirmation or a prompt; a choice's only where it names
one), a choice's dangerous action and its others, a prompt's placeholder,
bound, purpose and starting words. It answers as its kind does: a
confirmation yes or no, a choice or a prompt its words where the user
accepted - a prompt's cut to its bound, by characters - and nothing where
not, an alert nothing. Questions show one at a
time in the order asked, each under a ticket of its own across the process
(`QuestionQueue`), so an answer after its runtime has gone answers nothing
of another's.

## Files

A file dialog is read from its act alike on every host (`HostFileDialog`):
one file to open, several, or a place to save, the kinds it offers, a
save's contents and its name. A save's name ends in an extension of its
kinds: where it ends in none, the first kind's first is added - unless it
is empty, which the platform names. A dialog that filters by extension
alone shows every kind's, in order, each once. A file dialog waits its turn
among the questions, one showing at a time, so a question never stands
over a dialog the user is still in, or under one. A host performing files
hands its `FileToolkit` to its performer beside its `ActToolkit`, and
declares `HostActs.files`; a host without one fails every act for files by
name. A file read and a launch answer when the platform does, never in the
turn that asked.

## Kept values

Every host keeps a value as its words, by one rule (`KeptWord`): a value is
kept as the words its key's kind reads back, and a value of another kind is
not kept. A key the application does not list still saves, as its value's
own kind - true or false, a number, words - which its key's kind reads back
once it is listed, as the application's session promises. The words stand in
the platform's own store where it has one - the preferences on a Mac and on
Android.

A host whose platform keeps no store an application can use keeps them in a
file of its own, and one codec says what the file holds (`KeptValuesText`): a
line a key, its name and its words apart by a tab - a tab, a line's end and a
backslash in either escaped - the keys in order, so the same values write the
same file. Where the file stands and how it is read and written is the
host's.

## Kept scenes

A host whose platform restores no windows keeps the application's scenes for
its next start itself (`SceneKeeper`), in a file of its own whose text one
codec writes (`KeptScenes`): a line for each scene, then a line for each of
its kept values - by key, in order, the value's kind a letter before its
words - then a line for each window of a kind of its own it has open, its
kind and the text of the value it was opened for. At the start each scene
kept connects before its first render, with its values, so a scene's state
never shows its default first; one new scene connects where none was kept.
Then each is offered the windows it had open, as the scene's
`windowRestored`: the scene opens the ones it still declares, and a window
of a kind it no longer declares is kept no more. The scenes are kept again
whenever the text they write changes - a scene's value the application
keeps, a window opened or closed, a scene ended - but not once no scene
stands: the last scene's end is the application's, and the next start finds
the scenes as they stood before it.

## Typed words

A field holds its words in its case: the program's are written so, and what
a user types is turned into it, then cut past the field's bound to its first
characters that fit, as the contract counts characters (`InputWords.held`,
`InputWords.cut`), and written back as the program's. A caret and a selection the tree puts, in characters,
reach a toolkit counting UTF-16 units as the units those characters take
(`InputWords.utf16Selection`), so a character outside the basic plane - an
emoji - is never split. A picker is given its choices where they changed, and
its choice only where the tree changed it or the choices (`PickerChoices`):
the user's own choice is never argued with.

## What typing is given

What a field's keyboard and the platform's checking of its words do is read
once from what the tree says (`InputTraits`): spell checking, prediction -
correction goes with it - and the input purpose, which picks the keys a
screen keyboard offers and where capitals go. Plain words are taken as typed:
no capitals, no checking, no correction, no prediction - a login, a code a
user types or a scanner enters. An address takes no capitals; text starts
its sentences in them; the default leaves the platform its own. Each host
tells its toolkit these in its own terms - a keyboard type, input flags, the
text checking a desktop does as the user types.

## A value in a range

A value a control holds inside a range - a slider's, a stepper's, a progress
bar's - follows one arithmetic on every host (`ValueArithmetic`): the range's
ends stand in order whichever the tree gave first; a step that does not move
is 1; a share of work past an end stands at that end, one that is no number
at the start; a slider's key moves a hundredth of its range and a page a
tenth; and a stepped number is written with as many decimals as its step,
its ends and its value take, so each reads exactly, and no more than six.

Such a control is written, as its value and its ends apply, by one rule
(`ElementValues.written`): the tree's value where the tree changed the value
or an end, else the value the control shows, so a hand on the thumb or the
buttons is never argued with. A range that moves takes the tree's value
again: the control stood clamped at the old range's end - a state's value
outside it, or one travelling to the value written with the range - and a
range widened over that value shows it rather than the end it stood at.

## The log

What a host says for whoever reads its log rather than its screen is one
line a message, begun by `SwiftOmniUI` and the host's name (`HostLog`), written
to standard error, which nothing buffers, so a line stands in the log before
whatever went wrong next; a platform whose log is its own - Android's - hands
the lines there.

## Core link

A runtime calls the running core through `CoreLink` alone: a render, a cycle,
an event, an act call and its answer, a user's report, the application's and
the scene's reports, the kept values and the doorbell's wait. The line is the
typed `HostBoundary` SPI. The lane codecs - a journey read from its
image and written back, a placement run - are arithmetic on values the runtime
already holds, and stay the SPI's.

## Names

An element's name is its stem: `Animator`, `StateChannels`, `PatchIntake`. The
host layer uses the stem; a host prefixes its toolkit to what only it has
(`AppKitFrameClock`). A native subclass keeps its toolkit's class word
(`AppKitScrollView`). Some words are reserved: an **engine** is only
application frame code, a **channel** only a state's, an **animation** one
animated value, a **cycle** only the display cycle, a **report** only the
user's change on its way to the core, and an **act** is a call the
application makes on a control. [The glossary](../glossary.md) maps every
SwiftOmniUI term to the common one.
## A day and a time

A picker holds a day and a time by one arithmetic on every host
(`CalendarArithmetic`): a day not in the Gregorian calendar - February 31st,
a thirteenth month - is refused, and the picker goes on showing the day it
had; a day past the range stands at its end, the range's ends in order
whichever the tree gave first; and a time is its hours, minutes and seconds
added up from midnight around the day, so 25:99 shows as 02:39.

What a picker shows - its list, its calendar, its clock - is opened and
closed by the program and by the user, and only the user's are heard
(`PickerOpening`): the program asks, and the toolkit's next opening or
closing is the echo of that request; the user's closing of what the program
opened is the user's, and heard.
