# Animation in the runtime

How a runtime animates: one animator advances every animation, one channel per
bound state feeds every control tied to it, and the animations a patch
describes are keyed by element and property. The timing laws are the core's,
`HostMotionLaw`; [the runtime](runtime.md) draws where these elements sit in a
frame.

## One animator

A value is animated by `Animator` alone. Every running animation is an
`Animation`: where each lane began, where it is going, its starting speed, its
timing and when it began. An animation is pure: its position is
`HostMotionLaw` at the time handed in, so a hand-wound clock reproduces every
frame. One advance moves every animation in `AnimationTarget` order - states
by number, then described properties by element and property, then layout
places by element - so two runs of the same frame write in the same order. An
animation that arrives leaves the animator, and with Reduce Animation every
animation arrives at once, at its destination.

## State channels

A host-carried `@State` has one channel, whatever number of controls are bound
to it. No control keeps its own copy of the animated value, so every bound
control stands at the same value and turns toward a new destination with the
same speed on the same frame. A control that joins mid-animation joins at the
value where the channel stands.

The channel is not a control's to end. It counts the controls wearing it; when
the last one lets go it goes too, but only once its animation has landed where
it was sent, so a control described again a moment later joins it where it
is. When the user takes the value on a two-way control, the animation stops
where the user holds it and its waiter hears that it was cut short.

## Described animation

A patch can describe how a property of an element moves to its new value.
`HostPatch.properties` stays the committed value; `DescribedMotion` owns only
the value drawn on the current frame, keyed by element and property. A new
animation of a property starts from where the running one stands, with its
speed.

A value moves as numeric lanes and only within one shape: a number, a list of
numbers of one length, a colour, or a structure whose kind and parts stay the
same - a gradient moves its geometry, stops and colours, never its kind or
stop count. A brush property moves only between two colours or two well-formed
brushes of one shape; anything else snaps. A themed value never moves.

## What travels

A host moves frame by frame only what its views present and whose values
travel: `TransitionSurface` names them, element type by element type - a
view's opacity, background, size and transform; a colour box's colour and
corners; a label's size and colour of type; a layout's padding and spacing;
a shape's fill and stroke; a window's place. A backend answers
`animates(_:)` from it, and the host layer then walks the value and hands
the backend each frame's. Every other pair arrives at once, rather than
keeping a animation alive that nothing shows: a host that answers no pair
animates nothing, however the tree asks.

What a moved value asks of the elements around it is the host layer's too
([one frame](runtime.md#one-frame)): a window's frame, a title bar's
colours and a stack's or a tabbed view's bar colours are the window's
chrome, which the host composes again on the frames that move them
(`WindowChrome.follows`).

## Layout animation

A layout works out where each child goes; `LayoutMotion` decides where the
child stands on the way. Why an arrangement happens decides everything:

- A patch reached the layout since its last arrangement: it holds something
  different - a row inserted, a card grown - and its children animate to their
  new places, under the layout's own animation or else the application's. A child
  that joins fades in.
- No patch: the room itself is moving - a window resized, a sidebar dragged -
  and every child follows exactly, because a child that glides after the
  user's own hand is late on every frame. A layout whose own width changed is
  this case even with a patch: its width is its parent's to say.
- The first arrangement arrives: the first thing anyone sees is the thing itself.

A size a child states for itself arrives while its place animates: a stated
size is either still or already animating on its own. Where a frame under the
layout is read, every child arrives, because each frame of an animation would
hand the reader of that frame a room nobody chose. The same place asked for
again keeps its running animation, and a new place bends a running one from
where it has reached, at its speed. A layout's children hold no strong
reference: a view the tree dropped is not kept alive for its place.

## Words at their destination

A child whose place travels is told where it is bound as it sets out
(`PlacedView.travels(to:)`), and that it is bound nowhere once it lands or
arrives. A view that lays out words lays them out at the size it is bound
for, its place travelling around them: at the widths the place passes
through, words that fit the destination on one line would break onto two
for as long as the place travels. Every other view stands at each size it
passes through.

## Showing and hiding

An element's showing moves by one rule on every host (`MountedElement`'s
`fadeIn`, `crossVisibility`); the host hands it the view (`FadingView`) and
what closes the layout over it. A child that joins a standing layout fades
in from nothing under the layout's animation, where its view presents opacity
and no state owns it; an opacity already on its way keeps its animation. A
change of visibility on an element already shown crosses under the
element's own animation or the application's: hidden, it fades out - standing
shown the while (`standsShown`) - and only as the fade ends, landed or cut
short, does it hide and its layout close over it; shown again mid-fade, it
comes back from the opacity it stands at; shown from nothing, it fades in.
Where nothing moves - no animation, or the user asked for less - nothing
crosses, and the view simply shows or hides.
