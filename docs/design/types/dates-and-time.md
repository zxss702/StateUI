# Dates and time

`CalendarDate` is a day, `ClockTime` a time of day, and `TimeZoneInfo` asks
the host about time zones. None of them uses Foundation.

## Without Foundation

SwiftOmniUI's days and times are values of its own rather than Foundation's
`Date`. Turning a Foundation date into text needs a date formatter, a date
formatter needs ICU, and ICU is what the library cannot have: on Windows it
ships as separate libraries, and a mismatched one takes the process down with
nothing to diagnose. Three integers need none of that. Zero-padding a number
is done by hand for the same reason.

## Three integers each way

`CalendarDate` is a year, a month and a day; `ClockTime` an hour, a minute,
a second and a millisecond. Each crosses as its integers - year, month, day,
or hour, minute, second - which is also how a picker reports them back, so
the two directions say the same thing and nothing has to agree about which
number is the month. A value read back takes the whole part of each number
and refuses any other shape, so a report that does not read leaves the
handler alone. On a carried state each lies as three lanes in the same
order.

## Nothing checks the values

Neither type checks that its numbers make a real day or time, and neither
does the host. February 31st crosses, and the host reads it as no day at
all, which leaves the property unset: a `DatePicker` goes on showing the
date it had. A host reads a time as a length of time since midnight, adding
the three numbers up, so `ClockTime(hour: 25, minute: 99)` reaches a picker
as 26 hours and 39 minutes past midnight rather than being refused.

## Whole seconds

A `TimePicker` picks hours and minutes on every platform and keeps nothing
finer than a second, so a host is handed whole seconds: a time that crosses,
or rides a carried state, comes back with a millisecond of 0. The
millisecond is there for `ClockTime.now()`.

## Text is not a display format

`text` writes one fixed shape, `2026-08-02` or `09:30:00`, for text an
application composes itself. How a picker writes a day or a time for the
user is its `.format(...)`, which the host applies against the user's
locale.

Reading text is strict. A day reads from `2026-08-02`, with or without the
leading zeros, each part digits alone - an empty part, a plus or a letter is
no day - and a year before the first carries a minus before its digits,
`-0005-03-01`, as `text` writes it, so every day reads back; a time from `09:30`, `09:30:05` or `09:30:05.123`, the
fraction exactly three digits. `05.12` would be 120 milliseconds wearing a
12, and refusing it keeps a truncated value visible. Any other shape reads as
nil, so text that is not a date shows up where it is read rather than
becoming a silent midnight.

## The clock is an act

Reading a clock is the platform's business, and the core has none of its
own: Foundation's calendar machinery arrives with ICU. `ClockTime.now()` is
an act the host answers with the local time as four numbers - hour, minute,
second, millisecond - with nothing formatted or parsed. The millisecond lets
a clock sleep to the next whole second instead of drifting past it.

## Time zones come from the host

Foundation's time zones do not answer the same way on every platform. Apple
platforms answer everything themselves. Android detects no zone until `TZ`
names one: its time zone database is packed in a format Foundation does not
read, so `TimeZone.current` comes up GMT, while a named zone resolves from
ICU's own copy. Windows links only FoundationEssentials, which carries no
zone database, so a named zone is nil there and nothing sets it.

`TimeZoneInfo` asks the host instead, so a zone reached through it is the
same answer everywhere, the way `ClockTime.now()` is the same clock
everywhere. The Gallery's Foundation probe sample shows each platform's
answers side by side. On Android, an application that wants Foundation's own
zones sets `TZ` to `TimeZoneInfo.local()` before its first `TimeZone` use,
since the variable is read ahead of any detection.

## An offset on a day

`utcOffset` answers a `Duration` rather than a `ClockTime`: an offset can be
negative, a `ClockTime` is a time of day, and `Duration` is the standard
library's own, needing no Foundation. The day decides the answer wherever
summer time does, so the host reads the day at noon, the one hour no zone
has ever moved. The zone crosses as text, because an IANA identifier is
text and names nothing the core knows, and a zone or a day left out crosses
as `.nothing`, meaning the local zone and today.
