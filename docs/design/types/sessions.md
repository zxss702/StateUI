# Sessions

A session is one opening of something an application declares, and the
runtime values that opening holds. Each is in the environment of everything
under it, so a view acts on the one it is in - from a handler, an engine or a
task alike - and says which by the session it holds.

## One opening of something declared

```text
  ApplicationSession   the application, from its start to the end of its process
       |
       +-- SceneSession     a scene, from its main window opening to its closing
              |
              +-- WindowSession    a window, from created to destroying
                     |
                     +-- PageSession     a content page, for as long as its element lives
```

Every property is a `@State`, so a view that reads one builds again when it
is written, and what a session is told stands until it is told otherwise.
An optional property is nil until written, which leaves the host's own
default standing.

## Told not derived

A page's title is not worked out from the page's state on every build: it is
what the page was told, and it changes when something says so, which is
exactly a `@State` a handler writes. So the page builds again when its
session is written, by the rule every state follows, and is asked nothing on
a build caused by anything else. What a page's `.onAppear` writes is in the
same patch that brings the page, so a presented page's style and a bar's
buttons are there when the platform first shows them.

## One per page held by its element

A page's view is a value its parent builds afresh on every render, so
nothing stored on it outlives a build. The session lives on the element the
page is: made when the page is first built, handed back on every build after,
and gone with it. An arrangement - a `NavigationStack`, a `TabView`, a
`NavigationSplitView` - is a page already and has no session: it is told what it is by
modifier, from `PageElement`.

## Values and views written into a session

A value written into a session is put on the node as the page or window
builds, and a colour or a picture with a half for each color scheme is picked
there, so it is right in both themes whenever it was written. A view written
into a session - a title view, a toolbar item, a title bar's slot - is built
where it is shown: a composed view there reads its own state as it builds,
builds again when that state moves, and a binding handed to a control keeps
it live. What the bar offers is what was written, so a caption that follows
the page's state is written again when that state moves.

## Collections hang as one node

A page's toolbar items and its menus each hang off the page as one node
holding the collection, `ToolbarItems` and `MenuBar`, rather than as one
node each. The host has a list to keep in step, and a list needs a parent of
its own to be matched against; a swipe view's actions hang the same way.

## Scenes and windows are read not held

`ApplicationSession.scenes` and `SceneSession.windows` are made as they are
read, from what is open: nothing in a session holds a scene or a window, each
scene holds its own session, and a window's session knows its scene without
keeping it. A session held after its scene ended answers that it has, through
the application's list of scenes, whoever keeps the scene's record alive.

A view outside every scene, window or page reads a standard session that does
nothing: a scene always in front that opens nothing, a window that closes
nothing, a page nothing shows. Every scene, window and content page offers
its own, nearer.

## Kept keys are declared

`persistentKeys` lists every key the application keeps between launches,
written in the application's `init`. Reading a `@State` is synchronous, so a
kept value must be in memory before the first view is built, and a store is
read key by key, each with the kind of value it holds. The host therefore
asks for the keys as the application registers, reads exactly those, and
hands back what it found before the first render.

A key left off the list is never read. State declared with it still saves,
because a write knows its own key, so its value appears one launch late: the
symptom is a setting that lags one run behind. The list is the one thing
that cannot be worked out from the views, because the views that would name
the keys do not exist yet when the store is read.

## Styles and animation stay in the core

`ApplicationSession.styles` and `.animation` are never sent to a host. A style
is resolved in the core into the controls it applies to, a colour pair in it
picked for the color scheme as each control builds, so a sheet written once serves
both themes, and a sheet written again is the next render's. What reaches
the host of a animation is the resolved law, beside each property that
animates.

## WindowScene geometry is a request

A window's position and size are requests to a host whose windows move and
resize. Each axis is independent: writing the width does not restore an old
height. An axis left nil stays under native window management, including the
platform's restoration and the user's resizing, and a host that shows its
windows full screen may keep the values without presenting them.
