# Drawing on a canvas

A `Canvas` draws what its closure writes with `Draw`. Drawing code is a
closure, and a closure is the one thing the boundary to a host cannot carry,
so a drawing crosses as what that code calls: one record per canvas
operation, in order, which the host replays against its toolkit's own canvas.

## A drawing is a list of records

A record is a list of typed values: the operation first, as the number both
sides spell, then its arguments as the things they are. A number crosses as
a number, a flag as a bool, a colour as its four bytes, an alignment as its
member's number, and text only where an author wrote some. The drawing is
the list of those records, so it crosses as one `.values` holding one
`.values` per instruction.

```text
  Draw.fillColor(.cornflowerBlue)
  Draw.fillRoundedRectangle(x: 0, y: 0, width: 120, height: 40, cornerRadius: 8)

  [[0, #FF6495ED], [13, 0, 0, 120, 40, 8]]
```

Nothing is formatted on this side and nothing is parsed on arrival.

## The kinds are the contract

`DrawCommand.Kind` numbers every operation, and the host switches on the
same numbers, case for case. A case is added at the end only: one inserted
in the middle renumbers every case after it, and a drawing then replays the
wrong instructions without a word from either side. The kinds are grouped
in their declaration: what the canvas draws with, outlines, solid shapes,
text, and where the canvas draws.

## Three lists for a relay

A host whose canvas stands beneath a relay - Java through JNI, C++ behind a
C ABI - takes the whole drawing in one crossing, however many instructions it
holds, as `HostDrawing` lays it out in three flat lists:

- `ints`: each instruction's kind, then its whole numbers - a colour as ARGB,
  a flag as 0 or 1, an alignment as its member's number, a text's index in
  `strings`, a path's count of curves;
- `numbers`: each instruction's numbers in order, a path's curves among them,
  each curve its kind (0 move, 1 line, 2 cubic, 3 quadratic, 4 close) and
  then its points;
- `strings`: the text the instructions write.

```text
  Draw.fillColor(.red)                      ints     [0, #FFFF0000, 13, 17, 1, 0, 0]
  Draw.fillRoundedRectangle(0, 0, 90, 30, 8)   numbers  [0, 0, 90, 30, 8, 0, 0, 90, 30]
  Draw.drawText("Go", 0, 0, 90, 30, .center)   strings  ["Go"]
```

A path's arcs arrive as the shared parser's cubic curves, so no relay parses
SVG; an arc or a wedge of an oval arrives as a path, its curves the host
layer's (`CanvasArithmetic.arc` - a turn or more the whole oval), so no relay
works out an arc. The records are read once, as every host drawing in Swift
reads them (`CanvasInstruction`), and the lists are the host layer's. An instruction whose values do not read whole is left out on this side,
and the relay reads each kind's values in the fixed order above: it trusts
the lists' shape and still stops at the first record that runs past their
ends.

## Settings hold until changed

A host drawing in Swift reads the records into instructions the same way on
every such host (`CanvasInstruction`), keeps what they set by one pen
(`CanvasPen`), and draws an arc as the curves the host layer makes of it
(`CanvasArithmetic`) - an arc of a whole turn the ellipse whole.

The instructions run in the order they are written, and a setting holds
until the next of its kind: a `fillColor` paints every fill after it until
another `fillColor`. `saveState` remembers the colours, sizes and transforms
in force and `restoreState` puts them back, which is what keeps one rotated
shape from turning the rest of the drawing.

`DrawingBuilder` collects the statements of a closure in order and, unlike
`ViewBuilder`, has `buildArray`, so a plain `for` loop inside a drawing
compiles: a chart draws a bar per value that way.

## Text in a box

`drawText` places text in a box rather than at a point. The box is what the
two alignments place the text in and what clips it, and its top is the top
of the box, not a baseline. `.start` and `.end` mean the box's left and
right, or top and bottom: a canvas draws in its own coordinates, not in a
reading direction.

## Themes in a drawing

A colour written `Color(light:dark:)` goes into its record as both halves.
The differ picks the half in force as it builds the canvas, which builds
again when the system color scheme changes; see
[a pair for each color scheme](colour-and-color-scheme.md#a-pair-for-each-color-scheme).
