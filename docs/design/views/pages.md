# Pages and windows

An application declares its structure as types. An `App` answers its
scene, a `Scene` its windows, a `WindowScene` its page, and a page shows views.
Each declares only what it is made of; what each one is while it runs lives in
its session.

## App scene window page

```text
  App ──scene──▶ Scene ──windows──▶ Windows ──main──▶ WindowScene ──page──▶ Page ──▶ view tree
                                               └──groups──▶ WindowGroup ──▶ WindowScene

  ApplicationSession    SceneSession        WindowSession             PageSession
  styles, animation,       open and close      title, frame, title bar,  title, buttons, menus,
  kept values           its windows         modal stack, lifecycle    bar requests, lifecycle
```

`App`, `Scene` and `WindowScene` are protocols with one composition getter
each. A page position takes `any Page`: every view is one, and so is each
arrangement. The sessions are objects in the environment of everything under
them, written like any state - usually from the `.onAppear` of what is shown -
so the tree is steered by `@State` and `@Environment` alone.

## Scenes

A scene is one session of the application: a main window, the windows that
serve it, and the state they share. An application declares one scene type,
and the platform makes as many instances of it as the user asks for: the first
at launch, another for every New WindowScene, and every one that was open when the
system restores the application's windows.

```text
  struct GalleryApp: App {
      @State private var library = Library()                  every session's
      var body: some Scene { GalleryScene().environment(library) }
  }

  struct GalleryScene: Scene {
      @State private var nav = Navigation()                   this session's
      var windows: Windows {
          Windows {
              WindowGroup(.fonts) { FontsWindow() }
              WindowGroup(.document, for: UUID.self) { $id in DocumentWindow(id: id) }
          } main: {
              MainWindow()
          }
          .environment(nav)
      }
  }
```

- A session's state is its scene type's own `@State`. Each session has its
  own, and every window of the session reads it, offered with `.environment`
  or handed in as a binding.
- A window of a group belongs to its scene. It opens through the scene's
  session, `scene.openWindow(.fonts)`, closes with the scene, may hide while
  another scene is in front, and is never what New WindowScene makes.
- What the system restores is what was open: each scene comes back with the
  windows it had and the values its `@State(sceneKey:)` held. A group's value
  is `Codable` for that reason, and a `WindowType` name is written down with
  every window, so it should not change between versions.

Which scenes are open is the library's to hold (`Scenes.swift`),
never the author's. A host maps sessions onto the scene or window identities
its platform provides; a host that shows one window refuses another with
`WindowError.unsupported`.

## A window is a placeholder

`WindowScene.body` answers a placeholder like a composed view's (`Node.composed`),
so a window declared as a type may hold `@State` of its own and is built again
on its own when that state changes. A window shown alone, outside every scene,
keeps its `WindowSession` on its element, the way a page does. A scene's
windows are handed theirs by the scene, which keeps them.

The session and, for a main window, the panel its scene's inspector docks in
are asked for inside the window's build, so the window is what builds again
when either moves. The session is also offered on the placeholder itself, so
the window's own `@Environment` resolves it as well as everything under it.

## The children of a window

A window node's children are its page, then what hangs off it - the title bar
and the modal stack, read off the session as the window builds - then its
overlay. The host finds them by type, so the order is this side's to settle,
and one order makes the window's children the same list in every run.

```text
  WindowScene
   ├── Page          the window's page
   ├── TitleBar      from WindowSession.titleBar
   ├── ModalStack    from WindowSession.modalStack
   └── Overlay
        └── ZStack       lets a click beside its layers through
             ├── …           WindowSession.overlays, each keyed by its OverlayKey's name
             └── panel       a docked inspector's, OverlayKey.inspector, zIndex over every other
```

The overlay is one node however many layers it holds, so a host lays one view
over the page and the sheets. Each layer is keyed by its `OverlayKey`, so a
layer coming or going leaves the others the elements they were. The inspector
docks by writing its own layer into its main window's session like any other,
the one road to the stack.

## Lifecycle reports one by one

A window and a page hear where they stand in their life - created, activated,
appearing, navigated to - through one handler written per report. The
handlers are written out one by one rather than iterated over a collection:
the patch is deterministic, and a dictionary or a set iterated into a message
can differ between two instances within one run.

## A page around a view

A view shown as a screen gets a page element around it (`Node.page`). The page
holds the view's `PageSession` for its life: kept while the same view stands
there - the same kind under the same explicit id - and made afresh for another.
The view stays the element it is, one level down, with its state, its inputs
and whatever was written on it, so a write to the session builds the page again
and carries the view whole.

The content comes first among the page's children, so a page that gains a
title view does not look to the differ as though its content moved. The view
is held as a node - interface, not an input anything compares - so the page is
built with its parent and the view is compared on its own.

## Arrangements are pages

`NavigationStack`, `TabView` and `NavigationSplitView` conform to `Page` and not to
`View`, so an arrangement stands only where a page stands: a stack written
inside a `VStack` does not compile. An arrangement is a page already and is
shown as it is, with no page element around it.

What a screen is - its title, its buttons - is its page's session. An
arrangement's bar belongs to the arrangement (`BarElement`) and looks the same
whichever page it shows. An arrangement is told its own title and icon by
modifier (`PageElement`), for where it is shown as an item of something else,
such as a tab.

## The stack is the state

What is on the native navigation stack is an array the author holds, of the
author's own type. Push is `path.append(_:)`, pop is `path.removeLast()`, back
to the root is `path = []`. There is no navigate call, no route string and no
registry: the stack is the state, so every question about where the
application is has an answer that can be read, tested and serialized on this
side. The host reconciles its native navigation to the described stack.

The destination closure is a `switch` over the author's own type, so the
compiler checks that every route has a page; a misspelled route string would
be a fault the user finds. The root page usually takes the binding: a page that
pushes has to be able to write the path, and `HomePage()` handed nothing
compiles and then cannot navigate.

A model may hold the path - `router.$path` is the path's own state - and be
offered to every page with `.environment(_:)`, naming the moves itself. The
library ships no router: its names would be the library's, and the array is
the whole mechanism.

## Navigation destinations

`.navigationDestination(for:)` registers a page factory for a presented
value's type on the view it is written on - the enclosing navigation stack
reads the factories off its root's node, so the registration never crosses to
the host: `Node.destinations` holds a `Node` builder per type, looked up as a
value of that type arrives at the stack. `.navigationDestination(item:)`
holds one factory an item binding drives instead: a non-nil item builds the
pushed page, a way back off it writes the item nil again. Both are the same
closure-over-author-type the stack's own `destination:` argument is - the
modifier is where the registration lives when the destination belongs to a
view inside the root rather than to the stack itself.

## An arrangement keys its pages

A page in an arrangement is keyed by the arrangement, never by the author. The
key is what pairs a report with the page it is about, so it belongs to the
mechanism; an `.id()` written on the view stays on the view the page shows.

```text
  NavigationStack   the root              "root"
                    a pushed page         "<depth>/<route>"
  ModalStack        a presented page      "<depth>/<sheet>"
  TabView        a tab's page          "<tab>"
  NavigationSplitView         the two pages         "sidebar", "detail"
```

On a stack neither half of the key is enough. Depth alone would hand the page
at index 1, and the `@State` in it, to whatever route replaced it after a pop
and a push. The route alone cannot tell two `.level(2)` pages apart, which a
stack may hold. A route always carries its depth, so no route's key can equal
the root's.

Tabs are keyed by value alone. A tab bar holding one tab twice is a mistake,
and keying by value lets the tabs be reordered without their pages being
rebuilt.

Routes, sheets and tabs are described into text, the way `ForEach` keys are
(builders.md, ForEach keys are text), so distinct values must describe
differently and a class does not qualify.

## A pop report only shortens

The platform's own way back - the arrow, the swipe, the system back gesture -
reports only once it has committed: an interactive swipe let go halfway pops
nothing and says nothing. The payload is how deep the stack now is, above the
root, and the path is truncated to match; the next render finds the native
stack already in the described state and does nothing. A modal that goes
without this side saying so - an interactive dismissal, a native back action,
the platform closing one because the page under it went - reports how many
remain, the same way.

The guard only ever shortens. A report as deep as the path already is, or
deeper, has been overtaken by another pop and would otherwise put pages back.
A report overtaken by a push is not recognized and truncates the path: a narrow
race - the user's back press has to land between a handler queuing a push and
that push being described - which resolves the way the user's finger said.
Recognizing it would take numbered reports, a moving part the stack does not
carry.

## Tabs report an index

Which tabs there are is a collection the author holds, of the author's own
type; which one shows is a binding of that same type. A collection rather than
a builder of pages is what makes the keys work: a tab is a value, so the page
for it can be keyed by it. The tabs are held as `AnyHashable`, since a
`TabView` is not generic, and opened again in `selection`, whose binding
says which type to expect.

The selection crosses as the index of the current page among the children -
the list the initializer described, so the two cannot mean different things. A
binding that names no tab says nothing, which is not an error: the platform
shows something, reports which, and the binding is written to match. That is
also how removing the selected tab resolves itself, with no rule of its own.

The user's choice arrives as an index into that list and is written only when
it moved: a binding written with the value it already holds would be a render
nobody asked for. The host guards the same from its side, and the pair keeps a
tab switch to exactly one render. A binding of a type the tabs are not names
nothing rather than trapping.

## Split view

A split view is two pages: a sidebar beside the page the user is looking at.
Whether the sidebar shows is a `Bool` the author holds, borrowed two-way.

The sidebar is an ordinary page. Its rows are whatever views the author writes,
a row is a button whose handler assigns state, and no item type, template or
selection of its own is the library's business. The platform's ways in and
out - its sidebar button, an edge swipe, a tap on the dimmed page - report only
once the gesture has finished, whatever it settled on, and are written only
when the value moved.

## The modal stack is a value

What is presented over a window is a stack of the author's own values, the
last on top: presenting is `sheets.append(.settings)`, closing is
`sheets.removeLast()`, closing everything is `sheets = []`. There is no present
call and no completion to await. It is a stack because the platforms make it
one: a sheet may present a sheet.

`ModalStack` is a value written into `WindowSession.modalStack` rather than a
modifier: the generic lives in its initializer, so a window's session holds one
plain `ModalStack` whatever the author's sheet type is. Its pages are built as
the window builds, from the array as it stands then, so a stack written once
presents whatever the array says and the window is what builds again when the
array moves. They sit under a wrapper node of their own, as a page's toolbar
items do, so the host has a list to keep in step apart from the window's own
children. The report that a modal has gone is the window's, since the stack
is the window's.

## What an arrangement does not offer

- No current page value: the bound path, selection or flag already says where
  the application is, before the host draws anything.
- No push, pop, present or select act: assigning the state is navigation.
- No separate push and pop notifications: the state is the one channel, and
  `.onChange(of: path)` observes every committed arrival and departure.
- No page look on a stack: a `NavigationStack` draws its bar and the page on
  top, and that page carries its own padding, background and safe-area inset.
- No builder of tab pages: a builder hands back an anonymous list whose only
  identity is position.
- No sidebar item type, template, header or footer: the sidebar is a page, and
  a header is a view at its top. No way to keep a split view with its sidebar
  turned off for good: an application with nothing for a sidebar does not use
  one. No shared overlay or split policy: that belongs to a platform's own
  container, and the host adapts its presentation.

## The application is named once

`stateUIUseApp` is the one line an application writes outside its interface,
in a `@_cdecl("swiftomniui_app_register")` function the host calls by name at
startup. That function lives in the application's own module and cannot move
into the library: on Android and Windows the application is a separate native
library, and nothing in it runs until something calls into it by name.

The application is made there, after anything an earlier one wrote into the
application's session has been forgotten, so its `init` starts from nothing.
It is kept for the life of the process, so `@State` declared on it is the
state that outlives every window. Its `init` is where the kept state's keys
are written: the host reads them as the application registers, before the
first view is built.
