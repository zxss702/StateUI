# Getting started

StateUI applications keep their interface and application state in a
platform-neutral Swift module. A small native executable imports that module
and the selected host package. The same application module can therefore be
started by another host without changing its view tree.

Five native hosts are active - AppKit, UIKit, Android Views, WinUI 3 and
GTK 4 - each Swift, in the application's own process. The supported setup is a
StateUI checkout: each host is a sibling Swift package whose manifest uses a
local dependency on the repository root. No host has a published package route
yet.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 or newer, with Xcode 27 and its Swift 6.4, for the AppKit host;
- a checkout of this repository;
- VS Code and Node.js 20 or newer, for the StateUI extension.

[UIKit host](hosts/uikit.md#requirements) lists what the UIKit host needs for
the iOS simulator, [Android Views host](hosts/android.md#requirements) what the
Android Views host needs as well, [WinUI host](hosts/winui.md#requirements) what the
WinUI host needs on Windows, and [GTK host](hosts/gtk.md#requirements) what
the GTK host needs on Linux.

With the extension installed ([Installing the extension](#installing-the-extension)),
**StateUI: Check Toolchain** in the Command Palette looks on this machine for
what these pages list for its platform's hosts, and says what to install for
whatever is missing.

## Working in VS Code

VS Code is where StateUI applications are built, run, debugged, and tested. The
StateUI extension in `lib/StateUI.VSCode` chooses the host and the application
once, and everything after that - the editor's completion, the launches, and
the suites - works as that host.

### Installing the extension

The extension is built from the checkout. From the repository root:

```bash
cd lib/StateUI.VSCode
npm ci
npm run package
code --install-extension ../../artifacts/stateui-*.vsix
```

`npm run package` writes `stateui-<version>.vsix` into `artifacts/` at the repository root.
Without the `code` command on the path, use **Extensions: Install from VSIX…**
in the Command Palette and pick that file. Build and install it again after
pulling changes to the extension.

The extension installs the **Swift** extension (swiftlang) with it. Install
**LLDB DAP** for the Swift debugger.

### Running an application

Open the repository folder. The status bar shows two StateUI items:

- **the host** - AppKit or Android. The editor works as that host: code under
  `#if APPKIT` is completed only while AppKit is chosen, and as Android the
  language server compiles for Android with the Swift SDK for Android.
  Switching restarts the Swift language server without reloading the window.
  Android is offered for an application with an Android head. Both run on
  macOS; on Windows and Linux the item says **no host**, and the editor and
  the suites work as plain Swift.
- **the application** - Gallery, HelloWorld, or any other under `apps/`. It is
  remembered for the workspace.

While the host is Android a third item shows the device: an attached phone or
a running emulator, or an emulator started when it is picked.

Press **F5** to run **StateUI: Debug**, or choose **StateUI: Release** in Run
and Debug. On AppKit the application's head is built and started under
`lldb-dap`. On Android it is built, installed and started on the chosen device,
and its terminal follows the application's log; a Debug launch then attaches
`lldb-dap` to it, and a Release one runs without a debugger.

`.vscode/launch.json` holds only those two launches. The extension resolves
each one into the chosen host's own debugger.

### Commands

The Command Palette offers the rest under **StateUI:**

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Select Host | AppKit or Android, as the status bar item does |
| Select Android Device | the device or emulator an Android head runs on |
| Select App | the application F5 runs |
| Run Tests | the workspace's suites, run as the chosen host |
| New App in apps/ | a new application beside Gallery and HelloWorld, made by `.scripts/new-app.sh` |
| Clean Index | removes the language server's index and builds it again |
| Check Toolchain | what this machine has of what its hosts need, and what to install for the rest |

The extension's own README, `lib/StateUI.VSCode/README.md`, describes each of
them in detail.

### From the command line

Every launch has a command-line equivalent. Build HelloWorld's AppKit head from
the repository root:

```bash
STATEUI_APPKIT=1 swift build --package-path apps/HelloWorld --product HelloWorldAppKit
```

The variable is what makes it an AppKit build: the manifest then declares the
AppKit head and defines `APPKIT`, and without it `swift test` compiles no part
of one host's half; see
[Project structure and development](development.md).

Run HelloWorld's Android head on a device - `.scripts/Android/devices.sh list`
names the devices:

```bash
.scripts/Android/run-app.sh apps/HelloWorld debug emulator-5554
```

Build the signed Gallery bundle with its resources and icon:

```bash
.scripts/AppKit/build-gallery-appkit.sh debug
```

A new application is HelloWorld under another name, with every head
HelloWorld has. This makes `apps/Notes` (`.scripts/new-app.ps1 -Name Notes`
on Windows):

```bash
.scripts/new-app.sh Notes
```

## App shape

Every application follows one structural path:

```text
App -> Scene -> WindowScene -> Page -> View
```

Each type declares exactly one composition property. Runtime properties such
as styles, window title, geometry, and page title belong to session objects in
the environment.

```swift internals
struct NotesApp: App {
    var body: some Scene { NotesWindow() }
}

struct NotesWindow: WindowScene {
    var page: any Page { NotesPage() }
}

struct NotesPage: View {
    @Environment private var page: PageSession
    @State private var note = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(note.isEmpty ? "A new note" : note)
            TextField($note).placeholder("Write something")
        }
        .spacing(12)
        .contentPadding(24)
        .onAppear { page.title = "Notes" }
    }
}
```

`App`, `Scene` and `WindowScene` are declarations, not native objects, and
so is the view a window shows as its page. Their sessions carry the identity
and mutable runtime state.
[Applications and sessions](interface/application-and-sessions.md) describes that model
in full.

## Two modules and one registration point

An application has two concerns:

```text
NotesUI                     NotesAppKit
------------------------    ---------------------------
imports StateUI             imports NotesUI
App and scenes      imports StateUIAppKit
windows and pages           locates native resources
state and styles            starts the AppKit host
no toolkit imports          contains no application UI
```

The UI module exports one stable registration function. Registration names the
application type to the host; it does not build native controls itself.

```swift internals
struct RegisteredApp: App {
    var body: some Scene { RegisteredWindow() }
}

struct RegisteredWindow: WindowScene {
    var page: any Page { RegisteredPage() }
}

struct RegisteredPage: View {
    var body: some View { Text("Hello, StateUI") }
}

@_cdecl("stateui_app_register")
public func stateui_app_register() {
    stateUIUseApp(RegisteredApp())
}
```

The AppKit executable registers the module and starts the host:

```swift quote
import Foundation
import NotesUI
import StateUIAppKit

stateui_app_register()

let application = URL(fileURLWithPath: #filePath)
    .deletingLastPathComponent()
    .deletingLastPathComponent()
    .deletingLastPathComponent()
let resources = application.appendingPathComponent("Resources/Images", isDirectory: true)

StateUIAppKit.run(
    resourceDirectory: resources,
    applicationIcon: application.appendingPathComponent("Resources/AppIcon/appicon_macos.svg"))
```

The head finds its artwork from its own source file, so it runs from any
directory. Its icon is drawn on macOS's icon grid; see
[AppKit host](hosts/appkit.md).

Registration and `run` happen once per process. All scenes and windows then
belong to one application tree, renderer generation, and native host. Opening a
new scene does not start another host; it asks that host to materialize another
native scene session.

The UIKit head calls the same `stateui_app_register` before `StateUIUIKit.run`;
[UIKit host](hosts/uikit.md) describes that head. The Android head calls it
when Android loads its library; [Android Views host](hosts/android.md)
describes that head.

The repository examples use this directory shape:

```text
apps/Notes/
  Package.swift
  Sources/
    NotesApp.swift
    NotesPage.swift
    Styles/
  Platforms/
    AppKit/
      main.swift
    Android/
      build.gradle.kts
      AndroidManifest.xml
      Swift/
  Resources/
    AppIcon/
    Images/
  Tests/
```

The application target depends only on the `StateUI` product. The executable
target depends on the application target and `StateUIAppKit`. Both targets
enable `NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault`; [Concurrency](interface/concurrency.md) explains
why that module-wide setting is part of the application contract.

## Controls and modifiers

A control's purpose value belongs in its initializer. Optional capabilities
are modifiers:

```swift internals
@State var accepted = false
@State var volume = 0.5

VStack {
    Text("Playback")
        .fontSize(24)

    Slider($volume)
        .minimum(0)
        .maximum(1)

    CheckBox($accepted)
}
```

A binding form is two-way where the control owns an editable value. Passing a
plain value describes it in one direction. A handler reports a user or
platform action; an application write does not synthesize that event.

The active surface and per-host evidence live in
[Platform contract](platform-contract.md). Public API documentation beside a
declaration explains its focused semantics.

## Adding source and resources

SwiftPM discovers every `.swift` file below a target's `path`; a source list is
unnecessary. Add application files below `Sources/` and keep native entry
points below `Platforms/<Host>/`.

Image names are application data. Put image files under the resource directory
passed to the host and refer to them through `ImageSource` or a string-literal
file name:

```swift
Image("stateui_tile.png")
    .frame(height: 120)
    .horizontalAlignment(.center)
```

The AppKit head reads `Resources/` beside its own sources, and the Android
head's build draws `Resources/Images` into the application's assets and its
icon from `Resources/AppIcon`. StateUI's core does not read a filesystem or
choose a platform image class.

## Next steps

Read [State and reactivity](concepts/state-and-reactivity.md) before building data flow,
then [Applications and sessions](interface/application-and-sessions.md) for navigation
and multiple windows. Run the Gallery whenever a feature's behavior is easier
to understand by using it than by reading about it.
