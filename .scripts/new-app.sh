# Creates a new SwiftOmniUI application in apps/: one page with a counter, and a
# head for every host.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./new-app.sh Name [apps-dir]
#
#     Name      letters and digits, starting with a letter. Becomes the
#               directory, the process name and the Swift module (NameUI).
#     apps-dir  where to create the application. Defaults to <repo>/apps.
#               Tests pass a temporary directory here.
#
# WHAT IT MAKES is apps/HelloWorld under another name - the worked example of
# the layout every application in apps/ has:
#
#     Package.swift         the application's Swift module, its tests and the
#                           heads Swift builds
#     Sources/              the application, its page, and Styles/
#     Tests/                an example test of the application's own logic
#     Resources/            the artwork
#     Platforms/AppKit/     the macOS head
#     Platforms/UIKit/      the iOS and iPadOS head, run on a simulator
#     Platforms/Android/    the Android Views head: its Gradle build and Swift/
#     Platforms/WinUI/      the WinUI 3 head, built on Windows
#     Platforms/GTK/        the GTK 4 head, built on Linux
#     Platforms/Web/        the Web head, a WebAssembly module in a browser's page
#
# HelloWorld is copied rather than kept here a second time, so the two never
# drift; what its builds write is left behind.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible - macOS ships that version and has not moved since.
