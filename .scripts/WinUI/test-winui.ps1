# Alone it runs the host's own tests, in one process. -Conformance runs the
# contract's families, whose verdicts are WinUI's column of the dictionary -
# each test in a process of its own, as WinUI keeps GDI objects of every
# window a test closes and a process holds only so many
# (docs/design/platforms/winui/conformance.md): some fifteen minutes, so on
# request. A filter runs the tests it names, each in a process of its own.
#
# The tests are built, the Windows App SDK laid beside the runner, and the run
# skips the build. A run with SWIFTOMNIUI_UPDATE_EXPORTS=1 writes each verdict file
# under the revision its family stands at
# (lib/SwiftOmniUI.Conformance/revisions.txt); -Stale runs only the conformance
# families whose verdicts stand at another revision, or at none - each other
# one's process ends at once.
