# Builds an application's WinUI head, lays the Windows App SDK beside it and
# starts it.
#
#   .\run-app.ps1 -App apps\HelloWorld [-Configuration debug|release] [-Architecture arm64|x64] [-Detach | -BuildOnly]
#
#   -App           the application's folder: Package.swift, and Platforms\WinUI
#   -Architecture  what the head is built for: this machine's own by default;
#                  an ARM64 machine builds x64 too, which Windows runs emulated
#   -Detach        returns once the application has started, instead of waiting
#                  for it and passing on what it writes
#   -BuildOnly     starts nothing: the head stands ready for a debugger to start
#
# Everything a build writes stays under <App>\.build\winui, each architecture's
# head in a folder of its own (--show-bin-path). Every SWIFTOMNIUI_ variable of the
# calling shell - SWIFTOMNIUI_TALLY=1, SWIFTOMNIUI_INSPECT=1 - reaches the
# application's environment.
