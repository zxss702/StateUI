// The Web host: Swift compiled to WebAssembly in the page, reading the typed patch and calling the DOM through the
// JavaScript relay in JavaScript/, whose functions CStateUIWeb declares as the module's imports. A sibling package,
// as every host is. WebAssembly links no library dynamically: the application, StateUI and this host are one
// module. It builds with the Swift SDK for WebAssembly, under STATEUI_HOST=web.
