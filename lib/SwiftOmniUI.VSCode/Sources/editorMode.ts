// What makes the EDITOR work as one host.
//
// Every extension runs in one extension-host process, and the Swift extension
// starts SourceKit-LSP with that process's environment beneath the
// `swift.swiftEnvironmentVariables` setting. So the host's variable is set
// here, on this process, and the language server is restarted: the variable is
// written to no settings file, and the manifest - whose cache keys on the
// environment - declares the host's head and defines its condition. SwiftOmniUI
// does not wait for the Swift extension to activate: it sets the variable as it
// activates itself, before that extension starts the server.
//
// EACH HOST INDEXES IN A DIRECTORY OF ITS OWN. The server prepares modules for
// its index with a build, and one directory shared by two hosts is two
// differently configured builds in one place - measured: "couldn't build
// GalleryUI.swiftmodule because of missing inputs". The directory is
// `swiftPM.scratchPath` in .sourcekit-lsp/config.json, the server's own file,
// which it reads from the root of EACH package and resolves against it - so it
// is written beside every application's Package.swift, and ignored by git.
//
// The index is prepared by a normal build, which also prepares the toolkit
// relays and generated resources selected by the root manifest.
//
// AND A RESTART WAITS FOR THE BUILDS ALREADY RUNNING THERE. A server that is
// stopped does not stop the build it started, so a quick switch there and back
// had two servers building in one directory - the same failure, a few seconds
// apart. Switches therefore run one at a time, and each waits until no build is
// running in the directories its server is about to build in.
//
// A HOST WHOSE HEADS RUN ON ANOTHER PLATFORM IS INDEXED FOR THAT PLATFORM. For
// Android the same file names the Swift SDK of the toolchain's release and the
// triple, found as .scripts/Android/build-swift.sh finds them. With no such SDK
// installed the editor still works as the host, compiling for this Mac, and
// says so. For UIKit it names the triple and the iOS simulator's SDK, which
// Xcode ships - found as .scripts/UIKit/tools.sh finds it. SwiftPM's own
// command infers that SDK from the triple, but the server's SwiftPM does not:
// measured, it compiled for the simulator against the macOS SDK, and nothing
// in a UIKit head resolved.
