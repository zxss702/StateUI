// What every application's head is built with: the host its build is for.
//
// A build names its host by one variable, STATEUI_HOST - appkit, uikit,
// android, winui, gtk or web - which its script or the editor sets. This manifest
// reads it once for every application: it depends on that host's package, and
// StateUIHead re-exports it. An application's manifest declares its head in
// Platforms/<Host> and names StateUIHead there, with no host package of its own.
