// The web view's GTK backend: WebKitGTK 6.0's web view, realized through the
// GTK host's registration of an application's own controls. A package of its
// own because WebKitGTK is a library the platform does not ship with GTK: an
// application showing a web view on GTK depends on it from its GTK head and
// calls StateUIWebViewGTK.register() before it runs; nothing else links WebKit.
// The GTK host's tests register it and run the web view's family through it.

// NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault, as every StateUI package; see ../../../Package.swift.
