// A RUN OF PLACEMENTS ON DRIVEN STATE: where every view of a layout goes, as numbers
// the host wears on its own frames.
//
// The whole of what crosses is one registration and, from then on, lanes -
// twelve a view and three for the law. So what has to hold is that the twelve
// are the twelve the host reads by stride, that the law is at the END where a
// view's own numbers are always at `12 × index`, and that a layout placed this
// way describes not one property of a placement.
//
// The types are in Types/Layout, PlacedRun.swift and Placement.swift; the
// host's half is MotionPlacement in StateUI.Runtime's MotionTargets.cs.
