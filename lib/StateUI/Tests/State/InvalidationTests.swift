// that runs when it should not - and one that fails to run when it should -
// look identical in the patch.

// The mechanism under test is in Invalidation.swift (reads), Renderer
// (changes and the choice of path) and Differ.revisit (the walk). The promise
// the whole thing rests on: a view is built again when its own recorded reads
// moved OR when its parent was built again - never skipped on a guess.
