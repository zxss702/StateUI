// What a PAGE puts in the patch, and the guards that keep the list complete.
//
// A page is not a control: it has no case in ControlTests, it cannot
// be styled, and `SourceTree.controlSources()` skips the file it lives in. So
// the coverage a control gets for free - every modifier exercised, every
// property carried - has to be written here instead, and this is the file that
// writes it.
//
// Everything a page can be told is its session's, in
// PageSession.swift, and everything a window can be told is its
// window session's, in WindowSession.swift - so the guards
// below read both files and insist the two exhaustive values in this one
// carry every key: the page for a page's, the window for a window's. A page
// writes its session from its own `.onAppear`, and what that writes is in
// the message that brings the page - so what a page carries is read off
// `Renders.settled`, which runs it the way the renderer does.
