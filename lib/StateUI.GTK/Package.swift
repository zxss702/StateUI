// The GTK 4 host: Swift in the application's process, reading the typed patch
// and calling GTK 4 and libadwaita through their C API - no relay beneath it.
// A sibling package, as the AppKit, Android Views and WinUI hosts are, so the
// one dynamic StateUI runtime is linked into the application rather than
// copied into a second library in the same process. It builds on Linux, where
// pkg-config finds libadwaita and the GTK it needs.
