// The path that describes nothing: a value the platform moves many times a
// second, and the arithmetic that follows it.
//
// What has to hold, and each of these is one test below: a write records
// nothing and asks for no render; the value is still THERE for whoever reads
// it; an element that drives a property says so in its message, by the state's
// number, its mode and its door; and `.inherited` on such a value means THIS
// element's law, resolved on this side because the host cannot read a animation
// plan.
//
// The mechanism is in Core/Carried; the MAUI host's half - which runs
// the cycle on the platform's own frames and writes the values onto the
// controls - is its StateChannels, CarriedReports and DisplayCycle.
