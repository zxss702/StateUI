// The journey every walked state is on, and what `$x.journey` offers.
//
// A state is DISCRETE - reading it answers the destination, writing it sends
// the value there - and its journey is a part of it: where the value is this
// frame, how fast, under what law, and the road to send it somewhere and wait.
// What these pin is that surface, the law's two homes (the declaration and the
// lanes), the landing rule for a state nothing wears, and `.custom`, which
// hands the walk to an engine on this side.
//
// Whose the value is, the number the host quotes it by and what a body that
// reads the journey pays are CarriedStateTests' and StateTests' business; this
// file is about the journey itself.
