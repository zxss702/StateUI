// WHO THE READER IS. A read at build makes the closure it happens in a reader
// of the state - the body, or the content of the container the read sits in -
// and a write to the state builds exactly that closure again: the container
// alone where the read is in a container, and nothing around it. Handing a
// state on as `$x` makes no reader at all (CarriedStateTests).
