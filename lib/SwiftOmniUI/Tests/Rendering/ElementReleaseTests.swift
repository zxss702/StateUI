// WHAT AN ELEMENT ATTACHES, AND WHETHER IT GOES WHEN THE ELEMENT DOES.
//
// A view hangs things outside the tree as it is described: a handler in the
// differ's table, an engine on the board, a registration on a state's image, a
// reading on the value it reads, a derived state on the state it is worked out
// from, an aim pointed at the element, a watcher on the platform's frame. Every
// one of them is a way from something that OUTLIVES the render back to the
// page - and one that nothing takes back is a page whose states are never
// freed, every visit leaving another set behind for the board to walk on every
// frame it runs.
//
// So there is a test here for each thing `Node` can carry, and each asks the
// same question in the same shape: describe the view, describe it AWAY - which
// is what navigating off a page is, and what tells the differ to forget the
// element - and then ask whether what it attached was let go.
//
// A test here going red is a leak, and the name says which. What was found by
// writing them: `.samples` kept a ring (the value, its image, the reading, and
// the closure back to the value) and a conversion kept another (the source, its
// derived state, and the conversion pointing back).
