// The shape of a composed view.
//
// A `View` is what a piece of interface IS in this library, and the
// question every one of them answers is: how does a caller configure it? The
// library answers with MODIFIERS - `GalleryView(cards).position($x)`
// - which is the same answer every control gives, because the rule is written
// down for controls: only the value that gives a control its purpose goes in
// the initializer.
//
// The gallery is held to the same answer as the library, because the app
// exists to show the library how to be written: a composed view configured
// through memberwise initializer arguments - `Card(title:summary:icon:action:)`
// - would teach a second answer to that one question, in the very place an
// author copies from.
//
// The line between the two is MECHANICAL, which is what makes it checkable: a
// stored property with a DEFAULT is one a caller may leave out, which is the
// definition of configuration; one without a default is the view's purpose and
// the initializer is where it belongs. So configuration is `private` with a
// modifier over it, and the memberwise initializer is not a configuration door.
//
// The same for an explicit initializer's parameters: a defaulted parameter is
// the same door with the same knob on it, so an optional argument is a second
// initializer delegating to the first - `GeometryReader` carries that pair.
