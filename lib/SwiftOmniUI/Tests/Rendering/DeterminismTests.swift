// The graph and the patch are DETERMINISTIC, and this is where that is proven.
//
// The claim is exact: the same application, described through the same
// sequence of state changes, produces the same patches - every run, every
// process, every machine. Not "usually the same": the same identities, handler
// ids, state numbers and orders, so a patch can be asserted on at all and two
// renders can be diffed against each other.
//
// Two things could break it, and there is a test here for each:
//
//   1. ORDER FROM A HASH. Swift seeds Dictionary and Set hashing per PROCESS,
//      so anything that reached a patch by iterating one - a handler id, a
//      child's place - would come out differently on the next run. The differ
//      hands out handler ids in name order; what proves it is
//      `testTheOrderAnAuthorWroteReachesNoHost`, which writes one tree twice
//      with its properties and handlers inserted in opposite orders.
//   2. ORDER FROM AN ADDRESS. `ObjectIdentifier` is a POINTER, and a sort or a
//      walk over one would be stable within a run and different in the next.
//      Two identical sessions in ONE process allocate different objects, so
//      `testASessionDescribedTwiceIsTheSamePatches` is what catches that. It
//      catches more than it was written for: Swift salts each Dictionary's hash
//      table with its own STORAGE ADDRESS, so two dictionaries holding the same
//      pairs, filled the same way, in one process, still iterate differently.
