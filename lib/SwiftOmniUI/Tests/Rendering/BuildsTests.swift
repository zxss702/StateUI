// What a view answers when it is asked why it is being described. The reading
// is the author's instrument for "this scrolls badly": it names the state a
// rebuild came from, and says `with its parent` where the view is only along
// for the ride - which is what points at the view that actually reads too
// much.
//
// The mechanism is in Builds.swift; the facts it reads are the differ's
// own - the reads recorded against an element, the changes a render carries,
// and the count kept on the element.
