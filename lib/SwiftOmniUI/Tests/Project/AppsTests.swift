// The applications under apps/, their artwork, and the scaffolder that makes
// one.
//
// An application lives under apps/<Name>/ and states every connection to the
// repository as a relative path - to the library's Swift packages and to the
// hosts'. A path that no longer resolves fails late: SwiftPM cannot resolve,
// with a message about the symptom rather than the move that caused it. These
// tests read the paths out of the manifests and resolve them here, so a moved
// directory names the file that still points at the old place.
//
// The scaffolder - .scripts/new-app.sh, .scripts/new-app.ps1, and the SwiftOmniUI
// extension's "New App in apps/" that runs them - makes an application by copying
// apps/HelloWorld under another name. The bash half runs here for real, into a
// temporary directory, and what it made is read back; the PowerShell half
// cannot run where these tests run, so it is held to agreement with the bash
// half.
