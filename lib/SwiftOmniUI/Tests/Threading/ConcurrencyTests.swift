// Acts sent from more than one thread at once.
//
// `async let` runs its child on the cooperative pool - Swift's design, a child
// task does not inherit the parent's actor - so two animations started with
// `async let` reach `Renderer.send` from pool threads while the host thread is
// taking acts and dispatching completions. The registry behind that is a
// dictionary and an array, and unguarded they are a data race: a lost
// continuation on a good day, which reads as a handler frozen at its `await`,
// and corrupted memory on a bad one.
//
// What these tests pin is the guarantee, not the crash: every act queued from a
// child task is taken exactly once, answered exactly once, and every awaiting
// handler comes back. Against the unguarded registry this fails by count -
// nondeterministically, but a loss is a red test rather than a hang, because
// the host loop below has an end.
