// Where a handler runs, and where it comes back: MainActor, the host's UI
// thread.
//
// This is the one part of the library whose failure is silent. A handler that
// resumes on the wrong thread writes state while the host is drawing, and one
// that never resumes leaves the interface standing, and nothing crashes
// reliably - which is why what it promises is written down here rather than
// remembered.
//
// What a headless test CAN show: that a handler which never awaits finishes
// inside the call that raised it, that one which does await does not and comes
// back without another event, that a job on the UI thread's queue wakes the
// host, and that every async function in the library is declared so that it
// stays on its caller's executor. A test that stands for the host runs on
// MainActor, as the host calls in on its UI thread. What it cannot show is the
// thread itself - there is no host here. That part was measured against a
// running app on every platform.
