// An aim: which control an act is about - the element's key, declared on the view
// with `@Aim` and filled by the differ as it walks.

///     WebView(address).aim(browser)
///     Button("Back").onClicked { try await browser.goBack() }
///
/// `.aim(_:)` puts it on a view, and the act reaches exactly that view: there is
/// no name to spell, and two instances of one composed view each aim at their
/// own. The declared type is the control, so the aim offers what that control
/// can do - `focus()` on any, `goBack` on a web view's. A view handed an aim keeps
/// it in a plain property and aims at its parent's control.
///
/// An aim is not a key: a collection's rows still want `.id()`, and the two
/// compose. An act on an aim that reached no view, or two, throws; one whose view
/// has left reports that no such view is on screen.
