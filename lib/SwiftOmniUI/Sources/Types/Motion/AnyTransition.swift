/// Inserted, the element arrives as the insertion phase says and animates to
/// where it stands; removed, it animates to the removal phase and goes, all
/// under the layout's animation or the one `.animation(_:)` names.

/// `move` slides by the element's own room: the host reads the frame the
/// layout gave it, so the same transition fits a small badge and a wide panel.
