// What this runtime says about itself, written to exports/ and held to it.
//
// The registrations ARE the declaration: nothing here is written by hand, so
// nothing here can disagree with the code. What it says is PRESENCE - which
// member this host realizes on which element - never ownership, which the
// contracts answer when the documents are rendered.
//
// Run with SWIFTOMNIUI_UPDATE_EXPORTS=1 to write the export instead of checking
// it, then read it in the diff.
