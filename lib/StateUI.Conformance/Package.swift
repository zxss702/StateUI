// The conformance suite: what executing StateUI's contract does, written once
// and run on every host against its real toolkit. Each host's test target
// links it and supplies a driver. A package of its own beside the core's tests,
// as the hosts are packages of their own, so the one dynamic StateUI runtime is
// linked rather than copied.
